    <h1>
      FINE FEATHERS
    </h1>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson awoke with a Sundayish feeling, probably due to the fact that
      it was Bank Holiday. He had been aware, in a dim fashion, of the rising of
      Mrs. Jobson some time before, and in a semi-conscious condition had taken
      over a large slice of unoccupied territory. He stretched himself and
      yawned, and then, by an effort of will, threw off the clothes and
      springing out of bed reached for his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an orderly man, and had hung them every night for over twenty years
      on the brass knob on his side of the bed. He had hung them there the night
      before, and now they had absconded with a pair of red braces just entering
      their teens. Instead, on a chair at the foot of the bed was a collection
      of garments that made him shudder. With trembling fingers he turned over a
      black tailcoat, a white waistcoat, and a pair of light check trousers. A
      white shirt, a collar, and tie kept them company, and, greatest outrage of
      all, a tall silk hat stood on its own band-box beside the chair. Mr.
      Jobson, fingering his bristly chin, stood: regarding the collection with a
      wan smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s their little game, is it?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Want to make a toff of
      me. Where&rsquo;s my clothes got to, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hasty search satisfied him that they were not in the room, and, pausing
      only to drape himself in the counterpane, he made his way into the next.
      He passed on to the others, and then, with a growing sense of alarm, stole
      softly downstairs and making his way to the shop continued the search.
      With the shutters up the place was almost in darkness, and in spite of his
      utmost care apples and potatoes rolled on to the floor and travelled
      across it in a succession of bumps. Then a sudden turn brought the scales
      clattering down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Alf!&rdquo; said a voice. &ldquo;Whatever are you a-doing of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson turned and eyed his wife, who was standing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for my clothes, mother,&rdquo; he replied, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clothes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson, with an obvious attempt at unconcerned
      speech. &ldquo;Clothes! Why, they&rsquo;re on the chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean clothes fit for a Christian to wear&mdash;fit for a greengrocer to
      wear,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a little surprise for you, dear,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Me and Bert and
      Gladys and Dorothy &lsquo;ave all been saving up for it for ever so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you all,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, feebly&mdash;&ldquo;very, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all been doing without things themselves to do it,&rdquo; interjected
      his wife. &ldquo;As for Gladys, I&rsquo;m sure nobody knows what she&rsquo;s given up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if nobody knows, it don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;As I was
      saying, it&rsquo;s very kind of you all, but I can&rsquo;t wear &lsquo;em. Where&rsquo;s my
      others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my others?&rdquo; repeated her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re being took care of,&rdquo; replied his wife, with spirit. &ldquo;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
      minding &lsquo;em for you&mdash;and you know what she is. H&rsquo;sh! Alf! Alf! I&rsquo;m
      surprised at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson coughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the collar, mother,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
      wore a collar for over twenty years; not since we was walking out
      together. And then I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More shame for you,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s no other
      respectable tradesman goes about with a handkerchief knotted round his
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps their skins ain&rsquo;t as tender as what mine is,&rdquo; urged Mr. Jobson;
      &ldquo;and besides, fancy me in a top-&rsquo;at! Why, I shall be the laughing-stock of
      the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the lower classes what would laugh,
      and nobody minds what they think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson sighed. &ldquo;Well, I shall &lsquo;ave to go back to bed again, then,&rdquo; he
      said, ruefully. &ldquo;So long, mother. Hope you have a pleasant time at the
      Palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a reef in the counterpane and with a fair amount of dignity,
      considering his appearance, stalked upstairs again and stood gloomily
      considering affairs in his bedroom. Ever since Gladys and Dorothy had been
      big enough to be objects of interest to the young men of the neighbourhood
      the clothes nuisance had been rampant. He peeped through the window-blind
      at the bright sunshine outside, and then looked back at the tumbled bed. A
      murmur of voices downstairs apprised him that the conspirators were
      awaiting the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed at last and stood like a lamb&mdash;a redfaced, bull-necked
      lamb&mdash; while Mrs. Jobson fastened his collar for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bert wanted to get a taller one,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but I said this would do
      to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted it to come over my mouth, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said the unfortunate Mr.
      Jobson. &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;ave it your own way. Don&rsquo;t mind about me. What with the
      trousers and the collar, I couldn&rsquo;t pick up a sovereign if I saw one in
      front of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see one I&rsquo;ll pick it up for you,&rdquo; said his wife, taking up the hat
      and moving towards the door. &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson, with his arms standing out stiffly from his sides and his head
      painfully erect, followed her downstairs, and a sudden hush as he entered
      the kitchen testified to the effect produced by his appearance. It was
      followed by a hum of admiration that sent the blood flying to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he couldn&rsquo;t have done it before I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the dutiful
      Gladys. &ldquo;Why, there ain&rsquo;t a man in the street looks a quarter as smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fits him like a glove!&rdquo; said Dorothy, walking round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the right length,&rdquo; said Bert, scrutinizing the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he stands as straight as a soldier,&rdquo; said Gladys, clasping her hands
      gleefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Collar,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, briefly. &ldquo;Can I &lsquo;ave it took off while I eat my
      bloater, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Alf,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Gladys, pour your father out a
      nice, strong, Pot cup o&rsquo; tea, and don&rsquo;t forget that the train starts at
      ha&rsquo; past ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll start all right when it sees me,&rdquo; observed Mr. Jobson, squinting
      down at his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and children, delighted with the success of their scheme, laughed
      applause, and Mr. Jobson somewhat gratified at the success of his retort,
      sat down and attacked his breakfast. A short clay pipe, smoked as a
      digestive, was impounded by the watchful Mrs. Jobson the moment he had
      finished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d smoke it along the street if I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; demanded her husband&mdash;&ldquo;always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in a top-&rsquo;at,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson, shaking her head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a tail-coat,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would spoil the other,&rdquo; said Gladys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish something would spoil the hat,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, wistfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      no good; I must smoke, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson smiled, and, going to the cupboard, produced, with a smile of
      triumph, an envelope containing seven dangerous-looking cigars. Mr. Jobson
      whistled, and taking one up examined it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they call &lsquo;em, mother?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Cut and Try Again
      Smokes&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson smiled vaguely. &ldquo;Me and the girls are going upstairs to get
      ready now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Keep your eye on him, Bert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father and son grinned at each other, and, to pass the time, took a cigar
      apiece. They had just finished them when a swish and rustle of skirts
      sounded from the stairs, and Mrs. Jobson and the girls, beautifully
      attired, entered the room and stood buttoning their gloves. A strong smell
      of scent fought with the aroma of the cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get round me like, so as to hide me a bit,&rdquo; entreated Mr. Jobson, as
      they quitted the house. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind so much when we get out of our
      street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson laughed his fears to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cross the road, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, urgently. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bill
      Foley standing at his door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife sniffed. &ldquo;Let him stand,&rdquo; she said, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Foley failed to avail himself of the permission. He regarded Mr.
      Jobson with dilated eyeballs, and, as the party approached, sank slowly
      into a sitting position on his doorstep, and as the door opened behind him
      rolled slowly over onto his back and presented an enormous pair of
      hobnailed soles to the gaze of an interested world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you &lsquo;ow it would be,&rdquo; said the blushing Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;You know what
      Bill&rsquo;s like as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife tossed her head and they all quickened their pace. The voice of
      the ingenious Mr. Foley calling piteously for his mother pursued them to
      the end of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew what it &lsquo;ud be,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, wiping his hot face. &ldquo;Bill will
      never let me &lsquo;ear the end of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said his wife, bridling. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you&rsquo;ve got to
      ask Bill Foley &lsquo;ow you&rsquo;re to dress? He&rsquo;ll soon get tired of it; and,
      besides, it&rsquo;s just as well to let him see who you are. There&rsquo;s not many
      tradesmen as would lower themselves by mixing with a plasterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson scratched his ear, but wisely refrained from speech. Once clear
      of his own district mental agitation subsided, but bodily discomfort
      increased at every step. The hat and the collar bothered him most, but
      every article of attire contributed its share. His uneasiness was so
      manifest that Mrs. Jobson, after a little womanly sympathy, suggested
      that, besides Sundays, it might be as well to wear them occasionally of an
      evening in order to get used to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, &lsquo;ave I got to wear them every Sunday?&rdquo; demanded the unfortunate,
      blankly; &ldquo;why, I thought they was only for Bank Holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson told him not to be silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight, I did,&rdquo; said her husband, earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea &lsquo;ow I&rsquo;m
      suffering; I&rsquo;ve got a headache, I&rsquo;m arf choked, and there&rsquo;s a feeling
      about my waist as though I&rsquo;m being cuddled by somebody I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson said it would soon wear off and, seated in the train that bore
      them to the Crystal Palace, put the hat on the rack. Her husband&rsquo;s attempt
      to leave it in the train was easily frustrated and his explanation that he
      had forgotten all about it received in silence. It was evident that he
      would require watching, and under the clear gaze of his children he seldom
      had a button undone for more than three minutes at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was hot and he perspired profusely. His collar lost its starch&mdash;
      a thing to be grateful for&mdash;and for the greater part of the day he
      wore his tie under the left ear. By the time they had arrived home again
      he was in a state of open mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; he said, loudly, as he tore the collar off and hung his
      coat on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of lamentation; but he remained firm. Dorothy began to
      sniff ominously, and Gladys spoke longingly of the fathers possessed by
      other girls. It was not until Mrs. Jobson sat eyeing her supper, instead
      of eating it, that he began to temporize. He gave way bit by bit, garment
      by garment. When he gave way at last on the great hat question, his wife
      took up her knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      His workaday clothes appeared in his bedroom next morning, but the others
      still remained in the clutches of Aunt Emma. The suit provided was of
      considerable antiquity, and at closing time, Mr. Jobson, after some
      hesitation, donned his new clothes and with a sheepish glance at his wife
      went out; Mrs. Jobson nodded delight at her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming round,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He liked that ticket-collector
      calling him &lsquo;sir&rsquo; yesterday. I noticed it. He&rsquo;s put on everything but the
      topper. Don&rsquo;t say nothing about it; take it as a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It became evident as the days wore on that she was right... Bit by bit she
      obtained the other clothes&mdash;with some difficulty&mdash;from Aunt
      Emma, but her husband still wore his best on Sundays and sometimes of an
      evening; and twice, on going into the bedroom suddenly, she had caught him
      surveying himself at different angles in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, moreover, he had spoken with some heat&mdash;for such a good-tempered
      man&mdash;on the shortcomings of Dorothy&rsquo;s laundry work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better put your collars out,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the shirts,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;Nothing looks worse than a bad got-up
      cuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting quite dressy,&rdquo; said his wife, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson eyed her seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother, no,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve done is to find out that you&rsquo;re
      right, as you always &lsquo;ave been. A man in my persition has got no right to
      dress as if he kept a stall on the kerb. It ain&rsquo;t fair to the gals, or to
      young Bert. I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em to be ashamed of their father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to improve,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;O&rsquo; course, it&rsquo;s no use
      dressing up and behaving wrong, and yesterday I bought a book what tells
      you all about behaviour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said the delighted Mrs. Jobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson was glad to find that her opinion on his purchase was shared by
      the rest of the family. Encouraged by their approval, he told them of the
      benefit he was deriving from it; and at tea-time that day, after a little
      hesitation, ventured to affirm that it was a book that might do them all
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said Gladys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, slowly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know before that it
      was wrong to blow your tea; and as for drinking it out of a saucer, the
      book says it&rsquo;s a thing that is only done by the lower orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in a hurry?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Bert Jobson, pausing with his saucer
      half way to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in anything,&rdquo; responded his father. &ldquo;A gentleman would rather
      go without his tea than drink it out of a saucer. That&rsquo;s the sort o&rsquo; thing
      Bill Foley would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bert Jobson drained his saucer thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Picking your teeth with your finger is wrong, too,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson,
      taking a breath. &ldquo;Food should be removed in a&mdash;a&mdash;un-undemonstrative
      fashion with the tip of the tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Gladys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knife,&rdquo; pursued her father&mdash;&ldquo;a knife should never in any
      circumstances be allowed near the mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made mother cut herself,&rdquo; said Gladys, sharply; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was my fork,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson. &ldquo;I was so busy listening I
      wasn&rsquo;t thinking what I was doing. Silly of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all do better in time,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;But what I want to
      know is, what about the gravy? You can&rsquo;t eat it with a fork, and it don&rsquo;t
      say nothing about a spoon. Oh, and what about our cold tubs, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold tubs?&rdquo; repeated his wife, staring at him. &ldquo;What cold tubs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cold tubs me and Bert ought to &lsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;It says in
      the book that an Englishman would just as soon think of going without his
      breakfus&rsquo; as his cold tub; and you know how fond I am of my breakfus&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about me and the gals?&rdquo; said the amazed Mrs. Jobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me, ma,&rdquo; said Gladys, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book don&rsquo;t say nothing about gals; it says Englishmen,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Jobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we ain&rsquo;t got a bathroom,&rdquo; said his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson. &ldquo;A washtub&rsquo;ll do. Me and Bert&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave
      a washtub each brought up overnight; and it&rsquo;ll be exercise for the gals
      bringing the water up of a morning to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the bewildered Mrs. Jobson. &ldquo;Anyway,
      you and Bert&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to carry the tubs up and down. Messy, I call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be done, mother,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson cheerfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the
      lower orders what don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave their cold tub reg&rsquo;lar. The book says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He trundled the tub upstairs the same night and, after his wife had gone
      downstairs next morning, opened the door and took in the can and pail that
      stood outside. He poured the contents into the tub, and, after eyeing it
      thoughtfully for some time, agitated the surface with his right foot. He
      dipped and dried that much enduring member some ten times, and after
      regarding the damp condition of the towels with great satisfaction,
      dressed himself and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all of a glow,&rdquo; he said, seating himself at the table. &ldquo;I believe I
      could eat a elephant. I feel as fresh as a daisy; don&rsquo;t you, Bert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson, junior, who had just come in from the shop, remarked, shortly,
      that he felt more like a blooming snowdrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And somebody slopped a lot of water over the stairs carrying it up,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Jobson. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe as everybody has cold baths of a morning. It
      don&rsquo;t seem wholesome to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson took a book from his pocket, and opening it at a certain page,
      handed it over to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to do the thing at all I must do it properly,&rdquo; he said,
      gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Bill Foley ever &lsquo;ad a cold tub in his life; he
      don&rsquo;t know no better. Gladys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; said that young lady, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you eating that kipper with your fingers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gladys turned and eyed her mother appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Page-page one hundred and something, I think it is,&rdquo; said her father,
      with his mouth full. &ldquo;&lsquo;Manners at the Dinner Table.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s near the end of
      the book, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I never do no worse than that I shan&rsquo;t come to no harm,&rdquo; said his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson shook his head at her, and after eating his breakfast with
      great care, wiped his mouth on his handkerchief and went into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson, looking after him, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
      taking it very serious&mdash;very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He washed his hands five times yesterday morning,&rdquo; said Dorothy, who had
      just come in from the shop to her breakfast; &ldquo;and kept customers waiting
      while he did it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cold-tub business I can&rsquo;t get over,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
      it&rsquo;s more trouble to empty them than what it is to fill them. There&rsquo;s
      quite enough work in the &lsquo;ouse as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; said Bert, with unwonted consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d leave me alone,&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;My food don&rsquo;t do me no good
      when he&rsquo;s watching every mouthful I eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of murmurings such as these Mr. Jobson heard nothing, and in view of the
      great improvement in his dress and manners, a strong resolution was passed
      to avoid the faintest appearance of discontent. Even when, satisfied with
      his own appearance, he set to work to improve that of Mrs. Jobson, that
      admirable woman made no complaint. Hitherto the brightness of her attire
      and the size of her hats had been held to atone for her lack of figure and
      the roomy comfort of her boots, but Mr. Jobson, infected with new ideas,
      refused to listen to such sophistry. He went shopping with Dorothy; and
      the Sunday after, when Mrs. Jobson went for an airing with him, she walked
      in boots with heels two inches high and toes that ended in a point. A
      waist that had disappeared some years before was recaptured and placed in
      durance vile; and a hat which called for a new style of hair-dressing
      completed the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look splendid, ma!&rdquo; said Gladys, as she watched their departure.
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel splendid,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Jobson to her husband. &ldquo;These &lsquo;ere
      boots feel red-&rsquo;ot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your usual size,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, looking across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the clothes seem just a teeny-weeny bit tight, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,&rdquo; continued
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson regarded her critically. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps they might have been let out
      a quarter of an inch,&rdquo; he: said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the best fit
      you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad for a long time, mother. I only &lsquo;ope the gals&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave such good
      figgers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife smiled faintly, but, with little breath for conversation, walked
      on for some time in silence. A growing redness of face testified to her
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I feel awful,&rdquo; she said at last, pressing her hand to her side.
      &ldquo;Awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to it,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, gently. &ldquo;Look at me! I felt
      like you do at first, and now I wouldn&rsquo;t go back to old clothes&mdash;and
      comfort&mdash;for anything. You&rsquo;ll get to love them boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only take &lsquo;em off I should love &lsquo;em better,&rdquo; said his wife,
      panting; &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t breathe properly&mdash;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look ripping, mother,&rdquo; said her husband, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife essayed another smile, but failed. She set her lips together and
      plodded on, Mr. Jobson chatting cheerily and taking no notice of the fact
      that she kept lurching against him. Two miles from home she stopped and
      eyed him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get these boots off, Alf, I shall be a &lsquo;elpless cripple for
      the rest of my days,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;My ankle&rsquo;s gone over three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t take &lsquo;em off here,&rdquo; said Mr. Jobson, hastily. &ldquo;Think &lsquo;ow it
      would look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must &lsquo;ave a cab or something,&rdquo; said his wife, hysterically. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
      get &lsquo;em off soon I shall scream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against the iron palings of a house for support, while Mr.
      Jobson, standing on the kerb, looked up and down the road for a cab. A
      four-wheeler appeared just in time to prevent the scandal&mdash;of Mrs.
      Jobson removing her boots in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; she gasped, as she climbed in. &ldquo;Never mind about untying
      &lsquo;em, Alf; cut the laces and get &lsquo;em off quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove home with the boots standing side by side on the seat in front
      of them. Mr. Jobson got out first and knocked at the door, and as soon as
      it opened Mrs. Jobson pattered across the intervening space with the boots
      dangling from her hand. She had nearly reached the door when Mr. Foley,
      who had a diabolical habit of always being on hand when he was least
      wanted, appeared suddenly from the offside of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been paddlin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jobson, safe in her doorway, drew herself up and, holding the boots
      behind her, surveyed him with a stare of high-bred disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been paddlin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he inquired
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you going down the road in &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said the unabashed Mr. Foley, &ldquo;and
      I says to myself, I says, &lsquo;Pride&rsquo;ll bear a pinch, but she&rsquo;s going too far.
      If she thinks that she can squeedge those little tootsywootsies of &lsquo;ers
      into them boo&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door slammed violently and left him exchanging grins with Mr. Jobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the &lsquo;at?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jobson winked. &ldquo;Bet you a level &lsquo;arf-dollar I ain&rsquo;t wearing it next
      Sunday,&rdquo; he said, in a hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Foley edged away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good many bets
      with you first and last, Alf, but I can&rsquo;t remember as I ever won one yet.
      So long.&rdquo;

      R. Joseph Gibbs finished his half-pint in the private bar of the Red Lion
      with the slowness of a man unable to see where the next was coming from,
      and, placing the mug on the counter, filled his pipe from a small paper of

    <p>
      &ldquo;First I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad since ten o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; he said, in a hard voice.

      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t go on for ever,&rdquo; said Bob Kidd, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask for&mdash;is work,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, impressively. &ldquo;Not slavery,
      mind yer, but work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather difficult to distinguish,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Specially for some people,&rdquo; added Mr. Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, gloomily. &ldquo;Go on. Stand a man &lsquo;arf a pint, and
      then go and hurt &lsquo;is feelings. Twice yesterday I wondered to myself what
      it would feel like to make a hole in the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots o&rsquo; chaps do do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave their wives and families to starve,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very often the wife is better off,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one mouth less
      for her to feed. Besides, she gen&rsquo;rally gets something. When pore old Bill
      went they &lsquo;ad a Friendly Lead at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; and got his missis
      pretty nearly seventeen pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe we&rsquo;d get more than that for your old woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no kids, and she could keep &lsquo;erself easy. Not that I want to
      encourage you to make away with yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs scowled and, tilting his mug, peered gloomily into the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe won&rsquo;t make no &lsquo;ole in the water,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, wagging his head.
      &ldquo;If it was beer, now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs turned and, drawing himself up to five feet three, surveyed the
      speaker with an offensive stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he need make a &lsquo;ole in anything,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, slowly.
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;ud do just as well if we said he &lsquo;ad. Then we could pass the hat
      round and share it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divide it into three halves and each &lsquo;ave one,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, nodding;
      &ldquo;but &lsquo;ow is it to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ave some more beer and think it over,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, pale with
      excitement. &ldquo;Three pints, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He and Mr. Brown took up their pints, and nodded at each other. Mr. Gibbs,
      toying idly with the handle of his, eyed them carefully. &ldquo;Mind, I&rsquo;m not
      promising anything,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Understand, I ain&rsquo;t a-committing of
      myself by drinking this &lsquo;ere pint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave it to me, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs left it to him after a discussion in which pints played a
      persuasive part; with the result that Mr. Brown, sitting in the same bar
      the next evening with two or three friends, was rudely disturbed by the
      cyclonic entrance of Mr. Kidd, who, dripping with water, sank on a bench
      and breathed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Joe&mdash;poor Joe Gibbs,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd. &ldquo;I was on Smith&rsquo;s wharf
      shifting that lighter to the next berth, and, o&rsquo; course Joe must come
      aboard to help. He was shoving her off with &lsquo;is foot when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and shuddered and, accepting a mug of beer, pending the
      arrival of some brandy that a sympathizer had ordered, drank it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all &lsquo;appened in a flash,&rdquo; he said, looking round. &ldquo;By the time I &lsquo;ad
      run round to his end he was just going down for the third time. I hung
      over the side and grabbed at &lsquo;im, and his collar and tie came off in my
      hand. Nearly went in, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out the collar and tie; and approving notice was taken of the fact
      that he was soaking wet from the top of his head to the middle button of
      his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pore chap!&rdquo; said the landlord, leaning over the bar. &ldquo;He was in &lsquo;ere only
      &lsquo;arf an hour ago, standing in this very bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s &lsquo;ad his last drop o&rsquo; beer,&rdquo; said a carman in a chastened
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than anybody can say,&rdquo; said the landlord, sharply. &ldquo;I never
      heard anything against the man; he&rsquo;s led a good life so far as I know, and
      &lsquo;ow can we tell that he won&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave beer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made Mr. Kidd a present of another small glass of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave any family, did he?&rdquo; he inquired, as he passed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd; &ldquo;and who&rsquo;s to tell that pore soul I don&rsquo;t
      know. She fair doated on &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Ow she&rsquo;s to live I don&rsquo;t know. I shall do
      what I can for &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, in a deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something ought to be done for &lsquo;er,&rdquo; said the carman, as he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First thing is to tell the police,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;They ought to
      know; then p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps one of them&rsquo;ll tell her. It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re paid for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so awfully sudden. I don&rsquo;t know where I am &lsquo;ardly,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s got a penny-piece in the &lsquo;ouse. Pore Joe &lsquo;ad a lot
      o&rsquo; pals. I wonder whether we could&rsquo;nt get up something for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go round and tell the police first,&rdquo; said the landlord, pursing up his
      lips thoughtfully. &ldquo;We can talk about that later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd thanked him warmly and withdrew, accompanied by Mr. Brown. Twenty
      minutes later they left the station, considerably relieved at the
      matter-of-fact way in which the police had received the tidings, and,
      hurrying across London Bridge, made their way towards a small figure
      supporting its back against a post in the Borough market.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, snappishly, as he turned at the sound of their
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sowed the seed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sowed the wot?&rdquo; demanded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs. &ldquo;An&rsquo; while your precious seed is a-coming up, wot am
      I to do? Wot about my comfortable &lsquo;ome? Wot about my bed and grub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His two friends looked at each other uneasily. In the excitement of the
      arrangements they had for gotten these things, and a long and sometimes
      painful experience of Mr. Gibbs showed them only too plainly where they
      were drifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to get a bed this side o&rsquo; the river somewhere,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Brown, slowly. &ldquo;Coffee-shop or something; and a smart, active man wot
      keeps his eyes open can always pick up a little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, furiously, in reply to the laugh, &ldquo;anything we
      lend you is to be paid back out of your half when you get it. And, wot&rsquo;s
      more, you don&rsquo;t get a ha&rsquo;penny till you&rsquo;ve come into a barber&rsquo;s shop and
      &lsquo;ad them whiskers off. We don&rsquo;t want no accidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link004" id="link004"></a> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="004.jpg (91K)" src="images/004.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs, with his back against the post, fought for his whiskers for
      nearly half an hour, and at the end of that time was led into a barber&rsquo;s,
      and in a state of sullen indignation proffered his request for a &ldquo;clean&rdquo;
       shave. He gazed at the bare-faced creature that confronted him in the
      glass after the operation in open-eyed consternation, and Messrs. Kidd and
      Brown&rsquo;s politeness easily gave way before their astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I may as well have a &lsquo;air-cut while I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs,
      after a lengthy survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a shampoo, sir?&rdquo; said the assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, turning a deaf ear to the frenzied
      expostulations of his financial backers. &ldquo;Wot is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat in amazed discomfort during the operation, and emerging with his
      friends remarked that he felt half a stone lighter. The information was
      received in stony silence, and, having spent some time in the selection,
      they found a quiet public-house, and in a retired corner formed themselves
      into a Committee of Ways and Means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for you to go on with,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, after he and Mr. Brown
      had each made a contribution; &ldquo;and, mind, it&rsquo;s coming off of your share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs nodded. &ldquo;And any evening you want to see me you&rsquo;ll find me in
      here,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Beer&rsquo;s ripping. Now you&rsquo;d better go and see my old
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two friends departed, and, to their great relief, found a little knot
      of people outside the abode of Mrs. Gibbs. It was clear that the news had
      been already broken, and, pushing their way upstairs, they found the widow
      with a damp handkerchief in her hand surrounded by attentive friends. In
      feeble accents she thanked Mr. Kidd for his noble attempts at rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t dry yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done wot I could,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, simply. &ldquo;Pore Joe! Nobody could ha&rsquo; 
      had a better pal. Nobody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always ready to lend a helping &lsquo;and to them as was in trouble, he was,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Brown, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ear, &lsquo;ear!&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll lend &lsquo;im a helping &lsquo;and,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, energetically. &ldquo;We
      can&rsquo;t do &lsquo;im no good, pore chap, but we can try and do something for &lsquo;er
      as is left behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly to the door, accompanied by Mr. Brown, and catching the
      eye of one or two of the men beckoned them to follow. Under his able
      guidance a small but gradually increasing crowd made its way to the &ldquo;Red
      Lion.&rdquo; For the next three or four days the friends worked unceasingly.
      Cards stating that a Friendly Lead would be held at the &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo; for
      the benefit of the widow of the late Mr. Joseph Gibbs, were distributed
      broadcast; and anecdotes portraying a singularly rare and beautiful
      character obtained an even wider circulation. Too late Wapping realized
      the benevolent disposition and the kindly but unobtrusive nature that had
      departed from it for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs, from his retreat across the water, fully shared his friends&rsquo; 
      enthusiasm, but an insane desire&mdash;engendered by vanity&mdash;to be
      present at the function was a source of considerable trouble and annoyance
      to them. When he offered to black his face and take part in the
      entertainment as a nigger minstrel, Mr. Kidd had to be led outside and
      kept there until such time as he could converse in English pure and
      undefiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting above &lsquo;imself, that&rsquo;s wot it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, as they wended
      their way home. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s having too much money out of us to spend; but it
      won&rsquo;t be for long now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s having a lord&rsquo;s life of it, while we&rsquo;re slaving ourselves to death,&rdquo;
       grumbled Mr. Kidd. &ldquo;I never see&rsquo;im looking so fat and well. By rights he
      oughtn&rsquo;t to &lsquo;ave the same share as wot we&rsquo;re going to &lsquo;ave; he ain&rsquo;t doing
      none of the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His ill-humour lasted until the night of the &ldquo;Lead,&rdquo; which, largely owing
      to the presence of a sporting fishmonger who had done well at the races
      that day, and some of his friends, realized a sum far beyond the
      expectations of the hard-working promoters. The fishmonger led off by
      placing a five-pound note in the plate, and the packed audience breathed
      so hard that the plate-holder&rsquo;s responsibility began to weigh upon his
      spirits. In all, a financial tribute of thirty-seven pounds three and
      fourpence was paid to the memory of the late Mr. Gibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over twelve quid apiece,&rdquo; said the delighted Mr. Kidd as he bade his
      co-worker good night. &ldquo;Sounds too good to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day passed all too slowly, but work was over at last, and Mr.
      Kidd led the way over London Bridge a yard or two ahead of the more
      phlegmatic Mr. Brown. Mr. Gibbs was in his old corner at the
      &ldquo;Wheelwright&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo; and, instead of going into ecstasies over the sum
      realized, hinted darkly that it would have been larger if he had been
      allowed to have had a hand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ardly pay me for my trouble,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      very dull over &lsquo;ere all alone by myself. By the time you two have &lsquo;ad your
      share, besides taking wot I owe you, there&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;ardly anything left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you another time,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, regarding him fixedly.
      &ldquo;Wot you&rsquo;ve got to do now is to come acrost the river with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to break the joyful news to your old woman that you&rsquo;re alive
      afore she starts spending money wot isn&rsquo;t hers,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd. &ldquo;And we
      want you to be close by in case she don&rsquo;t believe us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do it gentle, mind,&rdquo; said the fond husband. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;er
      screaming, or anything o&rsquo; that sort. I know &lsquo;er better than wot you do,
      and my advice to you is to go easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked along by the side of them, and, after some demur, consented, as
      a further disguise, to put on a pair of spectacles, for which Mr. Kidd&rsquo;s
      wife&rsquo;s mother had been hunting high and low since eight o&rsquo;clock that
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doddle about &lsquo;ere for ten minutes,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, as they reached
      the Monument, &ldquo;and then foller on. When you pass a lamp-post &lsquo;old your
      handkerchief up to your face. And wait for us at the corner of your road
      till we come for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went off at a brisk pace with Mr. Brown, a pace moderated to one of
      almost funeral solemnity as they approached the residence of Mrs. Gibbs.
      To their relief she was alone, and after the usual amenities thanked them
      warmly for all they had done for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do more than that for pore Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;they &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t found &lsquo;im yet?&rdquo; said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd shook his head. &ldquo;My idea is they won&rsquo;t find &lsquo;im,&rdquo; he said,
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went down on the ebb tide,&rdquo; explained Mr. Brown; and spoilt Mr. Kidd&rsquo;s
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever he is &lsquo;e&rsquo;s better off,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more trouble about being out o&rsquo; work; no more worry; no more pain.
      We&rsquo;ve all got to go some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; began Mr. Kidd; &ldquo;but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t wish &lsquo;im back,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs; &ldquo;that would be sinful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But &lsquo;ow if he wanted to come back?&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, playing for an
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;elp you spend that money,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, ignoring the scowls of
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs looked bewildered. &ldquo;Spend the money?&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, &ldquo;suppose he wasn&rsquo;t drownded after all? Only last
      night I dreamt he was alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was smiling at me,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, in a tender voice. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bob,&rsquo; he ses,
      &lsquo;go and tell my pore missis that I&rsquo;m alive,&rsquo; he ses; &lsquo;break it to &lsquo;er
      gentle.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very words he said to me in my dream,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown. &ldquo;Bit
      strange, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, after a pause, &ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t been
      dreaming about &lsquo;im?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m a teetotaller,&rdquo; said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen exchanged glances, and Mr. Kidd, ever of an impulsive
      nature, resolved to bring matters to a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot would you do if Joe was to come in &lsquo;ere at this door?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scream the house down,&rdquo; said the widow, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scream&mdash;scream the &lsquo;ouse down?&rdquo; said the distressed Mr. Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs nodded. &ldquo;I should go screaming, raving mad,&rdquo; she said, with
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but not if &lsquo;e was alive!&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      speak out plain? Poor Joe is drownded, you know that; you saw it all, and
      yet you come talking to me about dreams and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd bent over her and put his hand affectionately on her shoulder.
      &ldquo;He escaped,&rdquo; he said, in a thrilling whisper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive and well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as I stand &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t it, George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truer,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs leaned back, gasping. &ldquo;Alive!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But &lsquo;ow? &lsquo;Ow can he
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a noise,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, earnestly. &ldquo;Mind, if anybody
      else gets to &lsquo;ear of it you&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to give that money back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give more than that to get &lsquo;im back,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs, wildly. &ldquo;I
      believe you&rsquo;re deceiving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as I stand &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; asseverated the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a minute or two
      off, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for you screaming I&rsquo;d go out and fetch &lsquo;im in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t scream,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs, &ldquo;not if I know it&rsquo;s flesh and blood.
      Oh, where is he? Why don&rsquo;t you bring &lsquo;im in? Let me go to &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, with a satisfied smile at Mr. Brown; &ldquo;all in
      good time. I&rsquo;ll go and fetch &lsquo;im now; but, mind, if you scream you&rsquo;ll
      spoil everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bustled cheerfully out of the room and downstairs, and Mrs. Gibbs,
      motioning Mr. Brown to silence, stood by the door with parted lips,
      waiting. Three or four minutes elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ere they come,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, as footsteps sounded on the stairs.
      &ldquo;Now, no screaming, mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs drew back, and, to the gratification of all concerned, did not
      utter a sound as Mr. Kidd, followed by her husband, entered the room. She
      stood looking expectantly towards the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, in a startled voice. &ldquo;Why here. Don&rsquo;t you know &lsquo;im?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Susan,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I might &lsquo;ave known it was a joke,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gibbs, in a faint
      voice, as she tottered to a chair. &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;ow cruel of you to tell me my pore
      Joe was alive! Oh, &lsquo;ow could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; lumme,&rdquo; said the incensed Mr. Kidd, pushing Mr. Gibbs forward. &ldquo;Here
      he is. Same as you saw &lsquo;im last, except for &lsquo;is whiskers. Don&rsquo;t make that
      sobbing noise; people&rsquo;ll be coming in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! Take &lsquo;im away,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gibbs. &ldquo;Go and play your tricks
      with somebody else&rsquo;s broken &lsquo;art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s your husband,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take &lsquo;im away,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Gibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd, grinding his teeth, tried to think. &ldquo;&lsquo;Ave you got any marks on
      your body, Joe?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got a mark on me,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs with a satisfied air, &ldquo;or a
      blemish. My skin is as whi&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough about your skin,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Kidd, rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t all of you gone before I count ten,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gibbs, in a
      suppressed voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scream. &lsquo;Ow dare you come into a respectable
      woman&rsquo;s place and talk about your skins? Are you going? One! Two! Three!
      Four! Five!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice rose with each numeral; and Mr. Gibbs himself led the way
      downstairs, and, followed by his friends, slipped nimbly round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder she didn&rsquo;t rouse the whole &lsquo;ouse,&rdquo; he said, wiping his brow
      on his sleeve; &ldquo;and where should we ha&rsquo; been then? I thought at the time
      it was a mistake you making me &lsquo;ave my whiskers off, but I let you know
      best. She&rsquo;s never seen me without &lsquo;em. I &lsquo;ad a remarkable strong growth
      when I was quite a boy. While other boys was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut-up!&rdquo; vociferated Mr. Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, defiantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad enough of being away from
      my comfortable little &lsquo;ome and my wife; and I&rsquo;m going to let &lsquo;em start
      growing agin this very night. She&rsquo;ll never reckernize me without &lsquo;em,
      that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean to tell me we&rsquo;ve got to wait till &lsquo;is blasted whiskers grow?&rdquo;
       cried Mr. Kidd, almost dancing with fury. &ldquo;And go on keeping &lsquo;im in
      idleness till they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it all back out o&rsquo; my share,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, with dignity.
      &ldquo;But you can please yourself. If you like to call it quits now, I don&rsquo;t
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown took his seething friend aside, and conferred with him in low
      but earnest tones. Mr. Gibbs, with an indifferent air, stood by whistling
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow long will they take to grow?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Kidd, turning to him with
      a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I should
      think two or three weeks would be enough for &lsquo;er to reckernize me by. If
      she don&rsquo;t, we must wait another week or so, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there won&rsquo;t be much o&rsquo; your share left, mind that,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd,
      glowering at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t keep reminding me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked the rest of the way in silence; and for the next fortnight Mr.
      Gibbs&rsquo;s friends paid nightly visits to note the change in his appearance,
      and grumble at its slowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and pull it off to-morrow night,&rdquo; said Mr. Kidd, at the end of
      that period. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair sick o&rsquo; lending you money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gibbs shook his head and spoke sagely about not spoiling the ship for
      a ha&rsquo;porth o&rsquo; tar; but Mr. Kidd was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough for &lsquo;er to reckernize you by,&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;and we
      don&rsquo;t want other people to. Meet us at the Monument at eight o&rsquo;clock
      to-morrow night, and we&rsquo;ll get it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give your orders,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs, in a nasty voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your &lsquo;at well over your eyes,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Kidd, sternly. &ldquo;Put
      them spectacles on wot I lent you, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea if you
      tied your face up in a piece o&rsquo; red flannel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know wot I&rsquo;m going to do without you telling me,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbs,
      nodding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you pots round that you don&rsquo;t either of you reckernize
      me tomorrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bet was taken at once, and from eight o&rsquo;clock until ten minutes to
      nine the following night Messrs. Kidd and Brown did their best to win it.
      Then did Mr. Kidd, turning to Mr. Brown in perplexity, inquire with many
      redundant words what it all meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must &lsquo;ave gone on by &lsquo;imself,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go and
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a state of some disorder they hurried back to Wapping, and, mounting
      the stairs to Mrs. Gibbs&rsquo;s room, found the door fast. To their fervent and
      repeated knocking there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t make her &lsquo;ear,&rdquo; said a woman, thrusting an untidy head over
      the balusters on the next landing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; exclaimed both gentlemen. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canada,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;She went off this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kidd leaned up against the wall for support; Mr. Brown stood
      open-mouthed and voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a surprise to me,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but she told me this morning
      she&rsquo;s been getting ready on the quiet for the last fortnight. Good spirits
      she was in, too; laughing like anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laughing!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Kidd, in a terrible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman nodded. &ldquo;And when I spoke about it and reminded &lsquo;er that she &lsquo;ad
      only just lost &lsquo;er pore husband, I thought she would ha&rsquo; burst,&rdquo; she said,
      severely. &ldquo;She sat down on that stair and laughed till the tears ran dowwn
      &lsquo;er face like water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown turned a bewildered face upon his partner. &ldquo;Laughing!&rdquo; he said,
      slowly. &ldquo;Wot &lsquo;ad she got to laugh at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two born-fools,&rdquo; replied Mr. Kidd.

    <h1>
      GOOD INTENTIONS
    </h1>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy; that&rsquo;s wot it is,&rdquo; said the night-watchman, trying to sneer&mdash;
      &ldquo;pure jealousy.&rdquo; He had left his broom for a hurried half-pint at the
      &ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s Head&rdquo;&mdash;left it leaning in a negligent attitude against the
      warehouse-wall; now, lashed to the top of the crane at the jetty end, it
      pointed its soiled bristles towards the evening sky and defied capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know who it is, and why &lsquo;e&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Fust and
      last, I don&rsquo;t suppose I was talking to the gal for more than ten minutes,
      and &lsquo;arf of that was about the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anybody &lsquo;as suffered more from jealousy than wot I &lsquo;ave:
      Other people&rsquo;s jealousy, I mean. Ever since I was married the missis has
      been setting traps for me, and asking people to keep an eye on me. I
      blacked one of the eyes once&mdash;like a fool&mdash;and the chap it
      belonged to made up a tale about me that I ain&rsquo;t lived down yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago, when I was out with the missis one evening, I saved a gal&rsquo;s
      life for her. She slipped as she was getting off a bus, and I caught &lsquo;er
      just in time. Fine strapping gal she was, and afore I could get my balance
      we &lsquo;ad danced round and round &lsquo;arfway acrost the road with our arms round
      each other&rsquo;s necks, and my missis watching us from the pavement. When we
      were safe, she said the gal &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t slipped at all; and, as soon as the gal
      &lsquo;ad got &lsquo;er breath, I&rsquo;m blest if she didn&rsquo;t say so too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t argufy with jealous people, and you can&rsquo;t shame &lsquo;em. When I
      told my missis once that I should never dream of being jealous of her,
      instead of up and thanking me for it, she spoilt the best frying-pan we
      ever had. When the widder-woman next-door but two and me &lsquo;ad rheumatics at
      the same time, she went and asked the doctor whether it was catching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worse trouble o&rsquo; that kind I ever got into was all through trying to
      do somebody else a kindness. I went out o&rsquo; my way to do it; I wasted the
      whole evening for the sake of other people, and got into such trouble over
      it that even now it gives me the cold shivers to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell was the man I tried to do a good turn to; a man what used
      to be master of a ketch called the <i>Lizzie and Annie,</i> trading
      between &lsquo;ere and Shoremouth. &lsquo;Artful Jack&rsquo; he used to be called, and if
      ever a man deserved the name, he did. A widder-man of about fifty, and as
      silly as a boy of fifteen. He &lsquo;ad been talking of getting married agin for
      over ten years, and, thinking it was only talk, I didn&rsquo;t give &lsquo;im any good
      advice. Then he told me one night that &lsquo;e was keeping company with a woman
      named Lamb, who lived at a place near Shoremouth. When I asked &lsquo;im what
      she looked like, he said that she had a good &lsquo;art, and, knowing wot that
      meant, I wasn&rsquo;t at all surprised when he told me some time arter that &lsquo;e
      had been a silly fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if she&rsquo;s got a good &lsquo;art,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she&rsquo;ll let you go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Talk sense,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t good enough for that. Why, she worships
      the ground I tread on. She thinks there is nobody like me in the whole
      wide world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope she&rsquo;ll think so arter you&rsquo;re married,&rsquo; I ses, trying to cheer
      him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to get married,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Leastways, not to &lsquo;er. But &lsquo;ow
      to get out of it without breaking her &lsquo;art and being had up for breach o&rsquo; 
      promise I can&rsquo;t think. And if the other one got to &lsquo;ear of it, I should
      lose her too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Other one?&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;wot other one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell shook his &lsquo;ead and smiled like a silly gal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She fell in love with me on top of a bus in the Mile End Road,&rsquo; he ses.
      &lsquo;Love at fust sight it was. She&rsquo;s a widder lady with a nice little &lsquo;ouse
      at Bow, and plenty to live on-her &lsquo;usband having been a builder. I don&rsquo;t
      know what to do. You see, if I married both of &lsquo;em it&rsquo;s sure to be found
      out sooner or later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be found out as it is,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;if you ain&rsquo;t careful. I&rsquo;m
      surprised at you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he ses, getting up and walking backwards and forwards; &lsquo;especially
      as Mrs. Plimmer is always talking about coming down to see the ship. One
      thing is, the crew won&rsquo;t give me away; they&rsquo;ve been with me too long for
      that. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you could give me a little advice, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. I talked to that man for an hour and a&rsquo;arf, and when I &lsquo;ad
      finished he said he didn&rsquo;t want that kind of advice at all. Wot &lsquo;e wanted
      was for me to tell &lsquo;im &lsquo;ow to get rid of Miss Lamb and marry Mrs. Plimmer
      without anybody being offended or having their feelings hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Plimmer came down to the ship the very next evening. Fine-looking
      woman she was, and, wot with &lsquo;er watch and chain and di&rsquo;mond rings and
      brooches and such-like, I should think she must &lsquo;ave &lsquo;ad five or six
      pounds&rsquo; worth of jewell&rsquo;ry on &lsquo;er. She gave me a very pleasant smile, and
      I gave &lsquo;er one back, and we stood chatting there like old friends till at
      last she tore &lsquo;erself away and went on board the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came off by and by hanging on Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell&rsquo;s arm. The cap&rsquo;n was
      dressed up in &lsquo;is Sunday clothes, with one of the cleanest collars on I
      &lsquo;ave ever seen in my life, and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape
      of gas. He came back alone at ha&rsquo;past eleven that night, and &lsquo;e told me
      that if it wasn&rsquo;t for the other one down Shoremouth way he should be the
      &lsquo;appiest man on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Plimmer&rsquo;s only got one fault,&rsquo; he ses, shaking his &lsquo;cad, &lsquo;and
      that&rsquo;s jealousy. If she got to know of Laura Lamb, it would be all U.P. It
      makes me go cold all over when I think of it. The only thing is to get
      married as quick as I can; then she can&rsquo;t help &lsquo;erself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t prevent the other one making a fuss, though,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he ses, very thoughtfully, &lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t. I shall &lsquo;ave to do
      something there, but wot, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He climbed on board like a man with a load on his mind, and arter a look
      at the sky went below and forgot both &lsquo;is troubles in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Plimmer came down to the wharf every time the ship was up, arter
      that. Sometimes she&rsquo;d spend the evening aboard, and sometimes they&rsquo;d go
      off and spend it somewhere else. She &lsquo;ad a fancy for the cabin, I think,
      and the cap&rsquo;n told me that she &lsquo;ad said when they were married she was
      going to sail with &lsquo;im sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But it ain&rsquo;t for six months yet,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;and a lot o&rsquo; things might
      &lsquo;appen to the other one in that time, with luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just about a month arter that that &lsquo;e came to me one evening
      trembling all over. I &lsquo;ad just come on dooty, and afore I could ask &lsquo;im
      wot was the matter he &lsquo;ad got me in the &lsquo;Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; and stood me three
      &lsquo;arf-pints, one arter the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m ruined,&rsquo; he ses in a &lsquo;usky whisper; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done for. Why was wimmen
      made? Wot good are they? Fancy &lsquo;ow bright and &lsquo;appy we should all be
      without &lsquo;em.&rsquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I started to p&rsquo;int out one or two things to &lsquo;im that he seemed to &lsquo;ave
      forgot, but &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t listen. He was so excited that he didn&rsquo;t seem to
      know wot &lsquo;e was doing, and arter he &lsquo;ad got three more &lsquo;arf-pints waiting
      for me, all in a row on the counter, I &lsquo;ad to ask &lsquo;im whether he thought I
      was there to do conjuring tricks, or wot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There was a letter waiting for me in the office,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;From Miss
      Lamb&mdash;she&rsquo;s in London. She&rsquo;s coming to pay me a surprise visit this
      evening&mdash;I know who&rsquo;ll get the surprise. Mrs. Plimmer&rsquo;s coming too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave &lsquo;im one of my &lsquo;arf-pints and made &lsquo;im drink it. He chucked the pot
      on the floor when he &lsquo;ad done, in a desprit sort o&rsquo; way, and &lsquo;im and the
      landlord &lsquo;ad a little breeze then that did &lsquo;im more good than wot the beer
      &lsquo;ad. When we came outside &lsquo;e seemed more contented with &lsquo;imself, but he
      shook his &lsquo;ead and got miserable as soon as we got to the wharf agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;S&rsquo;pose they both come along at the same time,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s to be
      done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shut the gate with a bang and fastened the wicket. Then I turned to &lsquo;im
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m watchman &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;and I lets in who I thinks I will. This
      ain&rsquo;t a public &lsquo;ighway,&rsquo; I ses; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a wharf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a genius.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If Miss Lamb comes &lsquo;ere asking arter you,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;I shall say you&rsquo;ve
      gone out for the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot about her letter?&rsquo; he ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave it,&rsquo; I ses, winking at &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And suppose she waits about outside for me, and Mrs. Plimmer wants me to
      take &lsquo;er out?&rsquo; he ses, shivering. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a fearful obstinate woman; and
      she&rsquo;d wait a week for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kept peeping up the road while we talked it over, and then we both see
      Mrs. Plimmer coming along. He backed on to the wharf and pulled out &lsquo;is
      purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; he ses, gabbling as fast as &lsquo;e could gabble, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s five or six
      shillings. If the other one comes and won&rsquo;t go away tell &lsquo;er I&rsquo;ve gone to
      the Pagoda Music-&rsquo;all and you&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;er to me, keep &lsquo;er out all the
      evening some&rsquo;ow, if you can, if she comes back too soon keep &lsquo;er in the
      office.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And wot about leaving the wharf and my dooty?&rsquo; I ses, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put Joe on to keep watch for you,&rsquo; he ses, pressing the money in my
      &lsquo;and. &lsquo;I rely on you, Bill, and I&rsquo;ll never forget you. You won&rsquo;t lose by
      it, trust me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He nipped off and tumbled aboard the ship afore I could say a word. I
      just stood there staring arter &lsquo;im and feeling the money, and afore I
      could make up my mind Mrs. Plimmer came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should never ha&rsquo; got rid of &lsquo;er. She stood there chatting and
      smiling, and seemed to forget all about the cap&rsquo;n, and every moment I was
      afraid that the other one might come up. At last she went off, looking
      behind &lsquo;er, to the ship, and then I went outside and put my back up agin
      the gate and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ad hardly been there ten minutes afore the other one came along. I saw
      &lsquo;er stop and speak to a policeman, and then she came straight over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want to see Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell,&rsquo; she ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell?&rsquo; I ses, very slow; &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell &lsquo;as gone off for the
      evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gone off!&rsquo; she ses, staring. &lsquo;But he can&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave. Are you sure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sartain,&rsquo; I ses. Then I &lsquo;ad a bright idea. &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s a letter come
      for &lsquo;im,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; she ses. &lsquo;And I thought it would be in plenty of time. Well,
      I must go on the ship and wait for &lsquo;im, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I &lsquo;ad only let &lsquo;er go I should ha&rsquo; saved myself a lot o&rsquo; trouble, and
      the man wot deserved it would ha&rsquo; got it. Instead o&rsquo; that I told &lsquo;er about
      the music-&rsquo;all, and arter carrying on like a silly gal o&rsquo; seventeen and
      saying she couldn&rsquo;t think of it, she gave way and said she&rsquo;d go with me to
      find &lsquo;im. I was all right so far as clothes went as it happened. Mrs.
      Plimmer said once that I got more and more dressy every time she saw me,
      and my missis &lsquo;ad said the same thing only in a different way. I just took
      a peep through the wicket and saw that Joe &lsquo;ad taken up my dooty, and then
      we set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure which one he&rsquo;d gone to, but we&rsquo;d try the
      Pagoda Music-&rsquo;all fust, and we went there on a bus from Aldgate. It was
      the fust evening out I &lsquo;ad &lsquo;ad for years, and I should &lsquo;ave enjoyed it if
      it &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t been for Miss Lamb. Wotever Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell could ha&rsquo; seen in &lsquo;er,
      I can&rsquo;t think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was quiet, and stupid, and bad-tempered. When the bus-conductor came
      round for the fares she &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t got any change; and when we got to the hall
      she did such eggsterrordinary things trying to find &lsquo;er pocket that I
      tried to look as if she didn&rsquo;t belong to me. When she left off she smiled
      and said she was farther off than ever, and arter three or four wot was
      standing there &lsquo;ad begged &lsquo;er to have another try, I &lsquo;ad to pay for the
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;ouse was pretty full when we got in, but she didn&rsquo;t take no notice
      of that. Her idea was that she could walk about all over the place looking
      for Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell, and it took three men in buttons and a policeman to
      persuade &lsquo;er different. We were pushed into a couple o&rsquo; seats at last, and
      then she started finding fault with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell?&rsquo; she ses. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you find him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and look for &lsquo;im in the bar presently,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s sure to be
      there, arter a turn or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I managed to keep &lsquo;er quiet for &lsquo;arf an hour&mdash;with the &lsquo;elp of the
      people wot sat near us&mdash;and then I &lsquo;ad to go. I &lsquo;ad a glass o&rsquo; beer
      to pass the time away, and, while I was drinking it, who should come up
      but the cook and one of the hands from the <i>Lizzie and Annie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We saw you,&rsquo; ses the cook, winking; &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t we Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Bob, shaking his silly &lsquo;ead; &lsquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t no surprise to me.
      I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad my eye on &lsquo;im for a long time past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought &lsquo;e was married,&rsquo; ses the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So he is,&rsquo; ses Bob, &lsquo;and to the best wife in London. I know where she
      lives. Mine&rsquo;s a bottle o&rsquo; Bass,&rsquo; he ses, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So&rsquo;s mine,&rsquo; ses the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid for two bottles for &lsquo;em, and arter that they said that they&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave
      a whisky and soda apiece just to show as there was no ill-feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very good,&rsquo; ses Bob, sipping his, &lsquo;but it wants a sixpenny cigar to
      go with it. It&rsquo;s been the dream o&rsquo; my life to smoke a sixpenny cigar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So it &lsquo;as mine,&rsquo; ses the cook, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both coughed arter that, and like a goodnatured fool I stood &lsquo;em a
      sixpenny cigar apiece, and I &lsquo;ad just turned to go back to my seat when up
      come two more hands from the Lizzie and Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Halloa, watchman!&rsquo; ses one of &lsquo;em. &lsquo;Why, I thought you was a-taking care
      of the wharf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got something better than the wharf to take care of,&rsquo; ses Bob,
      grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know; we see &lsquo;im,&rsquo; ses the other chap. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching &lsquo;is
      goings-on for the last &lsquo;arf-hour; better than a play it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped their mouths with a glass o&rsquo; bitter each, and went back to my
      seat while they was drinking it. I told Miss Lamb in whispers that &lsquo;e
      wasn&rsquo;t there, but I&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave another look for him by and by. If she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      whispered back it would ha&rsquo; been all right, but she wouldn&rsquo;t, and, arter a
      most unpleasant scene, she walked out with her &lsquo;ead in the air follered by
      me with two men in buttons and a policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo; course, nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait
      for Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell, and all the way there I was wondering wot would &lsquo;appen
      if she went on board and found &lsquo;im there with Mrs. Plimmer. However, when
      we got there I persuaded &lsquo;er to go into the office while I went aboard to
      see if I could find out where he was, and three minutes arterwards he was
      standing with me behind the galley, trembling all over and patting me on
      the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Keep &lsquo;er in the office a little longer,&rsquo; he ses, in a whisper. &lsquo;The
      other&rsquo;s going soon. Keep &lsquo;er there as long as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And suppose she sees you and Mrs. Plimmer passing the window?&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right; I&rsquo;m going to take &lsquo;er to the stairs in the ship&rsquo;s
      boat,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more romantic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me a little punch in the ribs, playfullike, and, arter telling me
      I was worth my weight in gold-dust, went back to the cabin agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Miss Lamb that the cabin was locked up, but that Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell was
      expected back in about &lsquo;arf-an-hour&rsquo;s time. Then I found &lsquo;er an old
      newspaper and a comfortable chair and sat down to wait. I couldn&rsquo;t go on
      the wharf for fear she&rsquo;d want to come with me, and I sat there as patient
      as I could, till a little clicking noise made us both start up and look at
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; she ses, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It sounded,&rsquo; I ses &lsquo;it sounded like somebody locking the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the door to try it just as somebody dashed past the window with
      their &lsquo;ead down. It was locked fast, and arter I had &lsquo;ad a try at it and
      Miss Lamb had &lsquo;ad a try at it, we stood and looked at each other in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s playing a joke on us,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Joke!&rsquo; ses Miss Lamb. &lsquo;Open that door at once. If you don&rsquo;t open it I&rsquo;ll
      call for the police.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at the windows, but the iron bars wot was strong enough to
      keep the vans outside was strong enough to keep &lsquo;er in, and then she gave
      way to such a fit o&rsquo; temper that I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing with &lsquo;er.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell can&rsquo;t be long now,&rsquo; I ses, as soon as I could get a word
      in. &lsquo;We shall get out as soon as e comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She flung &lsquo;erself down in the chair agin with &lsquo;er back to me, and for
      nearly three-quarters of an hour we sat there without a word. Then, to our
      joy, we &lsquo;eard footsteps turn in at the gate. Quick footsteps they was.
      Somebody turned the handle of the door, and then a face looked in at the
      window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise. A face that
      was as white as chalk with temper, and a bonnet cocked over one eye with
      walking fast. She shook &lsquo;er fist at me, and then she shook it at Miss
      Lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; ses Miss Lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My missis,&rsquo; I ses, in a loud voice. &lsquo;Thank goodness she&rsquo;s come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Open the door!&rsquo; ses my missis, with a screech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;OPEN THE DOOR!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s locked it. This is Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell&rsquo;s young
      lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell &lsquo;er when I get in!&rsquo; ses my wife. &lsquo;You too. I&rsquo;ll
      music-&rsquo;all you! I&rsquo;ll learn you to go gallivanting about! Open the door!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She walked up and down the alley-way in front of the window waiting for
      me just like a lion walking up and down its cage waiting for its dinner,
      and I made up my mind then and there that I should &lsquo;ave to make a clean
      breast of it and let Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell get out of it the best way he could. I
      wasn&rsquo;t going to suffer for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow long my missis walked up and down there I don&rsquo;t know. It seemed ages
      to me; but at last I &lsquo;eard footsteps and voices, and Bob and the cook and
      the other two chaps wot we &lsquo;ad met at the music&rsquo;all came along and stood
      grinning in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s locked us in,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Go and fetch Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell?&rsquo; ses the cook. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want to see &lsquo;im. Why, he&rsquo;s the
      last man in the world you ought to want to see! You don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;ow jealous
      he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You go and fetch &lsquo;im, I ses. &lsquo;&rsquo;Ow dare you talk like that afore my
      wife!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I dursen&rsquo;t take the responserbility,&rsquo; ses the cook. &lsquo;It might mean
      bloodshed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You go and fetch &lsquo;im,&rsquo; ses my missis. &lsquo;Never mind about the bloodshed. I
      don&rsquo;t. Open the door!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She started banging on the door agin, and arter talking among themselves
      for a time they moved off to the ship. They came back in three or four
      minutes, and the cook &lsquo;eld up something in front of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The boy &lsquo;ad got it,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Now shall I open the door and let your
      missis in, or would you rather stay where you are in peace and quietness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw my missis jump at the key, and Bob and the others, laughing fit to
      split their sides, &lsquo;olding her back. Then I heard a shout, and the next
      moment Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell came up and asked &lsquo;em wot the trouble was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all started talking at once, and then the cap&rsquo;n, arter one look in
      at the window, threw up his &lsquo;ands and staggered back as if &lsquo;e couldn&rsquo;t
      believe his eyesight. He stood dazed-like for a second or two, and then &lsquo;e
      took the key out of the cook&rsquo;s &lsquo;and, opened the door, and walked in. The
      four men was close be&rsquo;ind &lsquo;im, and, do all she could, my missis couldn&rsquo;t
      get in front of &lsquo;em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Watchman!&rsquo; he ses, in a stuck-up voice, &lsquo;wot does this mean? Laura Lamb!
      wot &lsquo;ave you got to say for yourself? Where &lsquo;ave you been all the
      evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been to a music-&rsquo;all with Bill,&rsquo; ses the cook. &lsquo;We saw &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;WOT?&rsquo; ses the cap&rsquo;n, falling back again. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was them,&rsquo; ses my wife. &lsquo;A little boy brought me a note telling me.
      You let me go; it&rsquo;s my husband, and I want to talk to &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; I ses, waving my &lsquo;and at Miss Lamb, wot was going to
      speak, and smiling at my missis, wot was trying to get at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We went to look for you,&rsquo; ses Miss Lamb, very quick. &lsquo;He said you were
      at the music-&rsquo;all, and as you &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t got my letter I thought it was very
      likely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But I did get your letter,&rsquo; ses the cap&rsquo;n.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He said you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; ses Miss Lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep quiet and let me explain? I can
      explain everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad o&rsquo; that, for your sake, my man,&rsquo; ses the cap&rsquo;n, looking at me
      very hard. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ope you will be able to explain &lsquo;ow it was you came to
      leave the wharf for three hours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it all then. If I split about Mrs. Plimmer, he&rsquo;d split to the
      guv&rsquo;nor about my leaving my dooty, and I should get the sack. I thought I
      should ha&rsquo; choked, and, judging by the way they banged me on the back, Bob
      and the cook thought so too. They &lsquo;elped me to a chair when I got better,
      and I sat there &lsquo;elpless while the cap&rsquo;n went on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no mischief-maker,&rsquo; he ses; &lsquo;and, besides, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;s been
      punished enough. And as far as I&rsquo;m concerned he can take this lady to a
      music-&rsquo;all every night of the week if &lsquo;e likes. I&rsquo;ve done with her.&rsquo;

      &ldquo;There was an eggsterrordinary noise from where my missis was standing;
      like the gurgling water makes sometimes running down the kitchen sink at
      &lsquo;ome, only worse. Then they all started talking together, and &lsquo;arf-a-dozen
      times or more Miss Lamb called me to back &lsquo;er up in wot she was saying,
      but I only shook my &lsquo;ead, and at last, arter tossing her &lsquo;ead at Cap&rsquo;n
      Tarbell and telling &lsquo;im she wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave &lsquo;im if he&rsquo;d got fifty million a
      year, the five of &lsquo;em &lsquo;eld my missis while she went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave &lsquo;er ten minutes&rsquo; start, and then Cap&rsquo;n Tarbell, arter looking
      at me and shaking his &lsquo;ead, said he was afraid they must be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And I &lsquo;ope this night&rsquo;ll be a lesson to you,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t neglect
      your dooty again. I shall keep my eye on you, and if you be&rsquo;ave yourself I
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say anything. Why, for all you know or could ha&rsquo; done the wharf
      might ha&rsquo; been burnt to the ground while you was away!&rsquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;He nodded to his crew, and they all walked out laughing and left me alone&mdash;with

      &ldquo;Come and have a pint and talk it over,&rdquo; said Mr. Augustus Teak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
      reasons in my &lsquo;ead that you don&rsquo;t dream of, Alf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase grunted and stole a side-glance at the small figure of his
      companion. &ldquo;All brains, you are, Gussie,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it is
      you&rsquo;re so well off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and have a pint,&rdquo; repeated the other, and with surprising ease
      pushed his bulky friend into the bar of the &ldquo;Ship and Anchor.&rdquo; Mr. Chase,
      mellowed by a long draught, placed his mug on the counter and eyeing him
      kindly, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in my lodgings thirteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got a partikler reason for wanting you.
      Our lodger, Mr. Dunn, left last week, and I only thought of you yesterday.
      I mentioned you to my missis, and she was quite pleased. You see, she
      knows I&rsquo;ve known you for over twenty years, and she wants to make sure of
      only &lsquo;aving honest people in the &lsquo;ouse. She has got a reason for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed one eye and nodded with great significance at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rich woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, pulling the other&rsquo;s ear down to his
      mouth. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve done tickling me with your whiskers,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase,
      withdrawing his head and rubbing his ear vigorously, &ldquo;I shall be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak apologized. &ldquo;A rich woman,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been stinting me
      for twenty-nine years and saving the money&mdash;my money!&mdash;money
      that I &lsquo;ave earned with the sweat of my brow. She &lsquo;as got over three
      &lsquo;undred pounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow much?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three &lsquo;undred pounds and more,&rdquo; repeated the other; &ldquo;and if she had &lsquo;ad
      the sense to put it in a bank it would ha&rsquo; been over four &lsquo;undred by this
      time. Instead o&rsquo; that she keeps it hid in the &lsquo;Ouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired the greatly interested Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to find out,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t know I know it; and she mustn&rsquo;t know, either. That&rsquo;s
      important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find out about it, then?&rdquo; inquired his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband, Bert Adams, told me. His wife told &lsquo;im in
      strict confidence; and I might &lsquo;ave gone to my grave without knowing about
      it, only she smacked his face for &lsquo;im the other night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s in the house you ought to be able to find it easy enough,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well to talk,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Teak. &ldquo;My missis never
      leaves the &lsquo;ouse unless I&rsquo;m with her, except when I&rsquo;m at work; and if she
      thought I knew of it she&rsquo;d take and put it in some bank or somewhere
      unbeknown to me, and I should be farther off it than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got no idea?&rdquo; said Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the leastest bit,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I never thought for a moment she
      was saving money. She&rsquo;s always asking me for more, for one thing; but,
      then women alway do. And look &lsquo;ow bad it is for her&mdash;saving money
      like that on the sly. She might grow into a miser, pore thing. For &lsquo;er own
      sake I ought to get hold of it, if it&rsquo;s only to save her from &lsquo;erself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase&rsquo;s face reflected the gravity of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only man I can trust,&rdquo; continued Mr. Teak, &ldquo;and I thought if
      you came as lodger you might be able to find out where it is hid, and get
      hold of it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me steal it, d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; demanded the gaping Mr. Chase. &ldquo;And suppose she
      got me locked up for it? I should look pretty, shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you find out where it is hid,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all you need
      do. I&rsquo;ll find someway of getting hold of it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you can&rsquo;t find it, how should I be able to?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cos you&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave opportunities,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I take her out some
      time when you&rsquo;re supposed to be out late; you come &lsquo;ome, let yourself in
      with your key, and spot the hiding-place. I get the cash, and give you
      ten-golden-sovereigns&mdash;all to your little self. It only occurred to
      me after Bert told me about it, that I ain&rsquo;t been in the house alone for
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ordered some more beer, and, drawing Mr. Chase to a bench, sat down to
      a long and steady argument. It shook his faith in human nature to find
      that his friend estimated the affair as a twenty-pound job, but he was in
      no position to bargain. They came out smoking twopenny cigars whose
      strength was remarkable for their age, and before they parted Mr. Chase
      was pledged to the hilt to do all that he could to save Mrs. Teak from the
      vice of avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a more difficult undertaking than he had supposed. The house, small
      and compact, seemed to offer few opportunities for the concealment of
      large sums of money, and after a fortnight&rsquo;s residence he came to the
      conclusion that the treasure must have been hidden in the garden. The
      unalloyed pleasure, however, with which Mrs. Teak regarded the efforts of
      her husband to put under cultivation land that had lain fallow for twenty
      years convinced both men that they were on a wrong scent. Mr. Teak, who
      did the digging, was the first to realize it, but his friend, pointing out
      the suspicions that might be engendered by a sudden cessation of labour,
      induced him to persevere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And try and look as if you liked it,&rdquo; he said, severely. &ldquo;Why, from the
      window even the back view of you looks disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair sick of it,&rdquo; declared Mr. Teak. &ldquo;Anybody might ha&rsquo; known she
      wouldn&rsquo;t have buried it in the garden. She must &lsquo;ave been saving for
      pretty near thirty years, week by week, and she couldn&rsquo;t keep coming out
      here to hide it. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase pondered. &ldquo;Let her know, casual like, that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be &lsquo;ome
      till late on Saturday,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Then you come &lsquo;ome in the
      afternoon and take her out. As soon as you&rsquo;re gone I&rsquo;ll pop in and have a
      thorough good hunt round. Is she fond of animals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve so,&rdquo; said the other, staring. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take &lsquo;er to the Zoo,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, impressively. &ldquo;Take two-penn&rsquo;orth
      o&rsquo; nuts with you for the monkeys, and some stale buns for&mdash;for&mdash;for
      animals as likes &lsquo;em. Give &lsquo;er a ride on the elephant and a ride on the
      camel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Teak disagreeably. &ldquo;Any more ways you can
      think of for me to spend my money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do as I tell you,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea now where it
      is. If I&rsquo;m able to show you where to put your finger on three &lsquo;undred
      pounds when you come &lsquo;ome it&rsquo;ll be the cheapest outing you have ever &lsquo;ad.
      Won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak made no reply, but, after spending the evening in deliberation,
      issued the invitation at the supper-table. His wife&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at
      first; then the light slowly faded from them and her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said, at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing to go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said her husband, starting uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said Mrs. Teak. &ldquo;I should like to go, too&mdash;it&rsquo;s years
      since I was at the Zoo. I might make my jacket do; it&rsquo;s my hat I&rsquo;m
      thinking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase, meeting Mr. Teak&rsquo;s eye, winked an obvious suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, thanking you all the same,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Teak, with amiable
      cheerfulness, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay at &lsquo;ome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow-&rsquo;ow much are they?&rdquo; growled her husband, scowling at Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All prices,&rdquo; replied his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, in a grating voice. &ldquo;You go in to buy a hat
      at one and eleven-pence; you get talked over and flattered by a man like a
      barber&rsquo;s block, and you come out with a four-and-six penny one. The only
      real difference in hats is the price, but women can never see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Teak smiled faintly, and again expressed her willingness to stay at
      home. They could spend the afternoon working in the garden, she said. Her
      husband, with another indignant glance at the right eye of Mr. Chase,
      which was still enacting the part of a camera-shutter, said that she could
      have a hat, but asked her to remember when buying it that nothing suited
      her so well as a plain one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the week passed away slowly; and Mr. Teak, despite his
      utmost efforts, was unable to glean any information from Mr. Chase as to
      that gentleman&rsquo;s ideas concerning the hiding-place. At every suggestion
      Mr. Chase&rsquo;s smile only got broader and more indulgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You leave it to me, and when you come home
      from a happy outing I &lsquo;ope to be able to cross your little hand with three
      &lsquo;undred golden quids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not tell me?&rdquo; urged Mr. Teak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cos I want to surprise you,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But mind, whatever you do,
      don&rsquo;t let your wife run away with the idea that I&rsquo;ve been mixed up in it
      at all. Now, if you worry me any more I shall ask you to make it thirty
      pounds for me instead of twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two friends parted at the corner of the road on Saturday afternoon,
      and Mr. Teak, conscious of his friend&rsquo;s impatience, sought to hurry his
      wife by occasionally calling the wrong time up the stairs. She came down
      at last, smiling, in a plain hat with three roses, two bows, and a
      feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the feather for years,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;This is the fourth hat it
      has been on&mdash;but, then, I&rsquo;ve taken care of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak grunted, and, opening the door, ushered her into the street. A
      sense of adventure, and the hope of a profitable afternoon made his
      spirits rise. He paid a compliment to the hat, and then, to the surprise
      of both, followed it up with another&mdash;a very little one&mdash;to his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took a tram at the end of the street, and for the sake of the air
      mounted to the top. Mrs. Teak leaned back in her seat with placid
      enjoyment, and for the first ten minutes amused herself with the life in
      the streets. Then she turned suddenly to her husband and declared that she
      had felt a spot of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Magination,&rdquo; he said, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something cold touched him lightly on the eyelid, a tiny pattering sounded
      from the seats, and then swish, down came the rain. With an angry
      exclamation he sprang up and followed his wife below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just our luck,&rdquo; she said, mournfully. &ldquo;Best thing we can do is to stay in
      the car and go back with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said her husband, in a startled&rsquo; voice; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be over in a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Events proved the contrary. By the time the car reached the terminus it
      was coming down heavily. Mrs. Teak settled herself squarely in her seat,
      and patches of blue sky, visible only to the eye of faith and her husband,
      failed to move her. Even his reckless reference to a cab failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; she said, tartly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go about the grounds in a cab,
      and I&rsquo;m not going to slop about in the wet to please anybody. We must go
      another time. It&rsquo;s hard luck, but there&rsquo;s worse things in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak, wondering as to the operations of Mr. Chase, agreed dumbly. He
      stopped the car at the corner of their road, and, holding his head down
      against the rain, sprinted towards home. Mrs. Teak, anxious for her hat,
      passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she inquired, fumbling in her pocket for the
      key as her husband executed a clumsy but noisy breakdown on the front
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link010" id="link010"></a> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="010.jpg (144K)" src="images/010.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chill,&rdquo; replied Mr. Teak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his lumberings and, the door being opened, gave vent to his
      relief at being home again in the dry, in a voice that made the windows
      rattle. Then with anxious eyes he watched his wife pass upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what excuse old Alf&rsquo;ll make for being in?&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with one foot on the bottom stair, listening acutely. He heard a
      door open above, and then a wild, ear-splitting shriek rang through the
      house. Instinctively he dashed upstairs and, following his wife into their
      bedroom, stood by her side gaping stupidly at a pair of legs standing on
      the hearthstone. As he watched they came backwards into the room, the
      upper part of a body materialized from the chimney, and turning round
      revealed the soot-stained face of Mr. Alfred Chase. Another wild shriek
      from Mrs. Teak greeted its appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hul-lo!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Teak, groping for the right thing to say. &ldquo;Hul-lo!
      What&mdash;what are you doing, Alf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase blew the soot from his lips. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I come &lsquo;ome
      unexpected,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;what are&mdash;you doing?&rdquo; panted Mrs. Teak, in a rising voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was passing your door,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, &ldquo;passing your door&mdash;to
      go to my room to&mdash;to &lsquo;ave a bit of a rinse, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Teak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase gave Mr. Teak a glance the pathos of which even the soot could
      not conceal. &ldquo;When I&mdash;I heard a pore little bird struggling in your
      chimbley,&rdquo; he continued, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Being fond of animals, I
      took the liberty of comin&rsquo; into your room and saving its life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak drew a breath, which he endeavoured in vain to render noiseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It got its pore little foot caught in the brickwork,&rdquo; continued the
      veracious Mr. Chase, tenderly. &ldquo;I released it, and it flowed&mdash;I mean
      flew&mdash;up the chimbley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the shamefaced air of a man detected in the performance of a noble
      action, he passed out of the room. Husband and wife eyed each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Alf&mdash;that&rsquo;s Alf all over,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, with enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been like it from a child. He&rsquo;s the sort of man that &lsquo;ud dive off
      Waterloo Bridge to save the life of a drownding sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s made an awful mess,&rdquo; said his wife, frowning; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll take me the
      rest of the day to clean up. There&rsquo;s soot everywhere. The rug is quite
      spoilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat and jacket and prepared for the fray. Down below
      Messrs. Teak and Chase, comparing notes, sought, with much warmth, to put
      the blame on the right shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made sure of that.
      That&rsquo;s something towards it. I shan&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave to look there again, thank
      goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak sniffed. &ldquo;Got any more ideas?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the other sternly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of places to search yet.
      I&rsquo;ve only just begun. Get her out as much as you can and I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave my
      hands on it afore you can say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soot?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Teak, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more of your nasty snacks and I chuck it up altogether,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Chase, heatedly. &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t hard up I&rsquo;d drop it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his room in dudgeon, and for the next few days Mr. Teak saw
      but little of him. To, lure Mrs. Teak out was almost as difficult as to
      persuade a snail to leave its shell, but he succeeded on two or three
      occasions, and each time she added something to her wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant fortune-hunter had been in residence just a month when Mr.
      Teak, returning home one afternoon, stood in the small passage listening
      to a suppressed wailing noise proceeding from upstairs. It was so creepy
      that half-way up he hesitated, and, in a stern but trembling voice,
      demanded to know what his wife meant by it. A louder wail than before was
      the only reply, and, summoning up his courage, he pushed open the door of
      the bedroom and peeped in. His gaze fell on Mrs. Teak, who was sitting on
      the hearth-rug, rocking to and fro in front of a dismantled fire-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Teak raised her voice to a pitch that set his teeth on edge. &ldquo;My
      money!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gone! All gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Teak, hardly able to contain himself. &ldquo;What money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;all my savings!&rdquo; moaned his wife. &ldquo;Savings!&rdquo; said the delighted
      Mr. Teak. &ldquo;What savings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money I have been putting by for our old age,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Three
      hundred and twenty-two pounds. All gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a fit of sudden generosity Mr. Teak decided then and there that Mr.
      Chase should have the odd twenty-two pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming!&rdquo; he said, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was,&rdquo; said his wife, wiping her eyes. &ldquo;Three hundred and
      twenty-two pounds in empty mustard-tins. Every ha&rsquo;penny&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak&rsquo;s eye fell on the stove. He stepped for ward and examined it. The
      back was out, and Mrs. Teak, calling his attention to a tunnel at the
      side, implored him to put his arm in and satisfy himself that it was
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where could you get all that money from?&rdquo; he demanded, after a
      prolonged groping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa&mdash;sa&mdash;saved it,&rdquo; sobbed his wife, &ldquo;for our old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our old age?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Teak, in lofty tones. &ldquo;And suppose I had died
      first? Or suppose you had died sudden? This is what comes of deceitfulness
      and keeping things from your husband. Now somebody has stole it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Teak bent her head and sobbed again. &ldquo;I&mdash;I had just been out for
      &mdash;for an hour,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;When I came back I fou&mdash;fou&mdash;found
      the washhouse window smashed, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobs choked her utterance. Mr. Teak, lost in admiration of Mr. Chase&rsquo;s
      cleverness, stood regarding her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what about the police?&rdquo; said his wife at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Teak, with extraordinary vehemence. &ldquo;Police!
      Certainly not. D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m going to let it be known all round that I&rsquo;m
      the husband of a miser? I&rsquo;d sooner lose ten times the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked solemnly out of the room and downstairs, and, safe in the
      parlour, gave vent to his feelings in a wild but silent hornpipe. He
      cannoned against the table at last, and, subsiding into an easy-chair,
      crammed his handkerchief to his mouth and gave way to suppressed mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement he forgot all about tea, and the bereaved Mrs. Teak made
      no attempt to come downstairs to prepare it. With his eye on the clock he
      waited with what patience he might for the arrival of Mr. Chase. The usual
      hour for his return came and went. Another hour passed; and another. A
      horrible idea that Mr. Chase had been robbed gave way to one more horrible
      still. He paced the room in dismay, until at nine o&rsquo;clock his wife came
      down, and in a languid fashion began to set the supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alf&rsquo;s very late,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; said his wife, dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very late,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;Ah, there he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a deep breath and clenched &lsquo;his hands together. By the time Mr.
      Chase came into the room he was able to greet him with a stealthy wink.
      Mr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad a upset,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, in warning tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said the other, as Mrs. Teak threw her apron over her head and sank
      into a chair. &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In bated accents, interrupted at times by broken murmurs from his wife,
      Mr. Teak informed him of the robbery. Mr. Chase, leaning against the
      doorpost, listened with open mouth and distended eyeballs. Occasional
      interjections of pity and surprise attested his interest. The tale
      finished, the gentlemen exchanged a significant wink and sighed in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak an hour later, after his wife had retired, &ldquo;where
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the question,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, roguishly. &ldquo;I wonder where it
      can be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope it&rsquo;s in a safe place,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, anxiously. &ldquo;Where
      &lsquo;ave you put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Mr. Chase. &ldquo;Who are you getting at? I ain&rsquo;t put it anywhere.
      You know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the giddy goat,&rdquo; said the other, testily. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you hid
      it? Is it safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase leaned back in his chair and, shaking his head at him, smiled
      approvingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little wonder, that&rsquo;s what you are, Gussie,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;No wonder your pore wife is took in so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak sprang up in a fury. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the fool,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the money? I want it. Now, where&rsquo;ve you put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Chase, with a chuckle. &ldquo;Go on. Don&rsquo;t mind me. You ought
      to be on the stage, Gussie, that&rsquo;s where you ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking,&rdquo; said Mr. Teak, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want
      you to joke with me. If you think you are going off with my money, you&rsquo;re
      mistook. If you don&rsquo;t tell me in two minutes where it is, I shall give you
      in charge for theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; said Mr. Chase. He took a deep breath. &ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave thought it of you, Gussie. I wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave thought you&rsquo;d
      have played it so low down. I&rsquo;m surprised at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought wrong, then,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to do me out o&rsquo; my twenty pounds, that&rsquo;s what you are,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Chase, knitting his brows. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t do, my boy. I wasn&rsquo;t born
      yesterday. Hand it over, afore I lose my temper. Twenty pounds I want of
      you, and I don&rsquo;t leave this room till I get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speechless with fury, Mr. Teak struck at him. The next moment the
      supper-table was overturned with a crash, and Mr. Chase, with his friend
      in his powerful grasp, was doing his best, as he expressed it, to shake
      the life out of him. A faint scream sounded from above, steps pattered on
      the stairs, and Mrs. Teak, with a red shawl round her shoulders, burst
      &lsquo;hurriedly into the room. Mr. Chase released Mr. Teak, opened his mouth to
      speak, and then, thinking better of it, dashed into the passage, took his
      hat from the peg, and, slamming the front door with extraordinary
      violence, departed.

      He sent round for his clothes next day, but he did not see Mr. Teak until
      a month afterwards. His fists clenched and his mouth hardened, but Mr.
      Teak, with a pathetic smile, held out his hand, and Mr. Chase, after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation, took it. Mr. Teak, still holding his friend&rsquo;s hand,
      piloted him to a neighbouring hostelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my mistake, Alf,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t my
      fault. It&rsquo;s a mistake anybody might ha&rsquo; made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found out who took it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Chase, regarding him
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teak gulped and nodded. &ldquo;I met Bert Adams yesterday,&rdquo; he said, slowly.
      &ldquo;It took three pints afore he told me, but I got it out of &lsquo;im at last. My
      missis took it herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase put his mug down with a bang. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after she found you with your head up the chimbley,&rdquo; added Mr.
      Teak, mournfully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s shoved it away in some bank now, and I shall
      never see a ha&rsquo;penny of it. If you was a married man, Alf, you&rsquo;d
      understand it better. You wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at anything.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most the only enj&rsquo;yment I&rsquo;ve got left,&rdquo; said the oldest
      inhabitant, taking a long, slow draught of beer, &ldquo;that and a pipe o&rsquo; 
      baccy. Neither of &lsquo;em wants chewing, and that&rsquo;s a great thing when you
      ain&rsquo;t got anything worth speaking about left to chew with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his mug on the table and, ignoring the stillness of the summer air,
      sheltered the flame of a match between his cupped hands and conveyed it
      with infinite care to the bowl of his pipe. A dull but crafty old eye
      squinting down the stem assured itself that the tobacco was well alight
      before the match was thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was a-saying, kindness to animals is all very well,&rdquo; he said to the
      wayfarer who sat opposite him in the shade of the &ldquo;Cauliflower&rdquo; elms; &ldquo;but
      kindness to your feller-creeturs is more. The pint wot you give me is
      gone, but I&rsquo;m just as thankful to you as if it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

      He half closed his eyes and, gazing on to the fields beyond, fell into a
      reverie so deep that he failed to observe the landlord come for his mug
      and return with it filled. A little start attested his surprise, and, to
      his great annoyance, upset a couple of tablespoonfuls of the precious
      liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people waste all their kindness on dumb animals,&rdquo; he remarked, after
      the landlord had withdrawn from his offended vision, &ldquo;but I was never a
      believer in it. I mind some time ago when a gen&rsquo;lemen from Lunnon wot &lsquo;ad
      more money than sense offered a prize for kindness to animals. I was the
      only one that didn&rsquo;t try for to win it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bunnett &lsquo;is name was, and &lsquo;e come down and took Farmer Hall&rsquo;s &lsquo;ouse
      for the summer. Over sixty &lsquo;e was, and old enough to know better. He used
      to put saucers of milk all round the &lsquo;ouse for cats to drink, and, by the
      time pore Farmer Hall got back, every cat for three miles round &lsquo;ad got in
      the habit of coming round to the back-door and asking for milk as if it
      was their right. Farmer Hall poisoned a saucer o&rsquo; milk at last, and then
      &lsquo;ad to pay five shillings for a thin black cat with a mangy tail and one
      eye that Bob Pretty said belonged to &lsquo;is children. Farmer Hall said he&rsquo;d
      go to jail afore he&rsquo;d pay, at fust, but arter five men &lsquo;ad spoke the truth
      and said they &lsquo;ad see Bob&rsquo;s youngsters tying a empty mustard-tin to its
      tail on&rsquo;y the day afore, he gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha was Bob Pretty all over, that was; the biggest raskel Claybury &lsquo;as
      ever had; and it wasn&rsquo;t the fust bit o&rsquo; money &lsquo;e made out o&rsquo; Mr. Bunnett
      coming to the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all come through Mr. Bunnett&rsquo;s love for animals. I never see a man so
      fond of animals as &lsquo;e was, and if he had &lsquo;ad &lsquo;is way Claybury would &lsquo;ave
      been overrun by &lsquo;em by this time. The day arter &lsquo;e got to the farm he
      couldn&rsquo;t eat &lsquo;is breakfuss because of a pig that was being killed in the
      yard, and it was no good pointing out to &lsquo;im that the pig was on&rsquo;y making
      a fuss about it because it was its nature so to do. He lived on wegetables
      and such like, and the way &lsquo;e carried on one day over &lsquo;arf a biled
      caterpillar &lsquo;e found in his cabbage wouldn&rsquo;t be believed. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat
      another mossel, but sat hunting &lsquo;igh and low for the other &lsquo;arf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t been in Claybury more than a week afore he said &lsquo;ow surprised
      &lsquo;e was to see &lsquo;ow pore dumb animals was treated. He made a little speech
      about it one evening up at the schoolroom, and, arter he &lsquo;ad finished, he
      up and offered to give a prize of a gold watch that used to belong to &lsquo;is
      dear sister wot loved animals, to the one wot was the kindest to &lsquo;em afore
      he left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; known Claybury men better &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it. The very
      next morning Bill Chambers took &lsquo;is baby&rsquo;s milk for the cat, and smacked
      &lsquo;is wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;ead for talking arter he&rsquo;d told &lsquo;er to stop. Henery Walker got
      into trouble for leaning over Charlie Stubbs&rsquo;s fence and feeding his
      chickens for &lsquo;im, and Sam Jones&rsquo;s wife had to run off &lsquo;ome to &lsquo;er mother
      &lsquo;arf-dressed because she had &lsquo;appened to overlay a sick rabbit wot Sam &lsquo;ad
      taken to bed with &lsquo;im to keep warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People used to stop animals in the road and try and do &lsquo;em a kindness&mdash;
      especially when Mr. Bunnett was passing&mdash;and Peter Gubbins walked
      past &lsquo;is house one day with ole Mrs. Broad&rsquo;s cat in &lsquo;is arms. A
      bad-tempered old cat it was, and, wot with Peter kissing the top of its
      &lsquo;ead and calling of it Tiddleums, it nearly went out of its mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fust time Mr. Bunnett see Bob Pretty was about a week arter he&rsquo;d
      offered that gold watch. Bob was stooping down very careful over something
      in the hedge, and Mr. Bunnett, going up quiet-like behind &lsquo;im, see &lsquo;im
      messing about with a pore old toad he &lsquo;ad found, with a smashed leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wots the matter with it?&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob didn&rsquo;t seem to hear &lsquo;im. He was a-kneeling on the ground with &lsquo;is
      &lsquo;ead on one side looking at the toad; and by and by he pulled out &lsquo;is
      pocket&rsquo;an&rsquo;kercher and put the toad in it, as if it was made of egg-shells,
      and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett, a&rsquo;most trotting to keep up
      with &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Got it&rsquo;s leg &lsquo;urt in some way, pore thing,&rsquo; ses Bob. &lsquo;I want to get it
      &lsquo;ome as soon as I can and wash it and put it on a piece o&rsquo; damp moss. But
      I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not long for this world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bunnett said it did &lsquo;im credit, and walked home alongside of &lsquo;im
      talking. He was surprised to find that Bob hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;eard anything of the
      gold watch &lsquo;e was offering, but Bob said he was a busy, &lsquo;ard-working man
      and didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave no time to go to hear speeches or listen to tittle-tattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When I&rsquo;ve done my day&rsquo;s work,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;I can always find a job in the
      garden, and arter that I go in and &lsquo;elp my missis put the children to bed.
      She ain&rsquo;t strong, pore thing, and it&rsquo;s better than wasting time and money
      up at the &ldquo;Cauliflower.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;ad a lot o&rsquo; talk with Mr. Bunnett for the next day or two, and when
      &lsquo;e went round with the toad on the third day as lively and well as
      possible the old gen&rsquo;leman said it was a miracle. And so it would ha&rsquo; been
      if it had been the same toad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took a great fancy to Bob Pretty, and somehow or other they was always
      dropping acrost each other. He met Bob with &lsquo;is dog one day&mdash;a large,
      ugly brute, but a&rsquo;most as clever as wot Bob was &lsquo;imself. It stood there
      with its tongue &lsquo;anging out and looking at Bob uneasy-like out of the
      corner of its eye as Bob stood a-patting of it and calling it pet names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo; Wunnerful affectionate old dog, ain&rsquo;t you, Joseph?&rsquo; ses Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a kind eye,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s like another child to me, ain&rsquo;t you, my pretty?&rsquo; ses Bob, smiling
      at &lsquo;im and feeling in &lsquo;is pocket. &lsquo;Here you are, old chap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He threw down a biskit so sudden that Joseph, thinking it was a stone,
      went off like a streak o&rsquo; lightning with &lsquo;is tail between &lsquo;is legs and
      yelping his &lsquo;ardest. Most men would ha&rsquo; looked a bit foolish, but Bob
      Pretty didn&rsquo;t turn a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t it wunnerful the sense they&rsquo;ve got,&rsquo; he ses to Mr. Bunnett, wot
      was still staring arter the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sense?&rsquo; ses the old gen&rsquo;leman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Bob smiling. &lsquo;His food ain&rsquo;t been agreeing with &lsquo;im lately and
      he&rsquo;s starving hisself for a bit to get round agin, and &lsquo;e knew that &lsquo;e
      couldn&rsquo;t trust hisself alongside o&rsquo; this biskit. Wot a pity men ain&rsquo;t like
      that with beer. I wish as &lsquo;ow Bill Chambers and Henery Walker and a few
      more &lsquo;ad been &lsquo;ere just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bunnett agreed with &lsquo;im, and said wot a pity it was everybody &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t
      got Bob Pretty&rsquo;s commonsense and good feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t that,&rsquo; ses Bob, shaking his &lsquo;ead at him; &lsquo;it ain&rsquo;t to my
      credit. I dessay if Sam Jones and Peter Gubbins, and Charlie Stubbs and
      Dicky Weed &lsquo;ad been brought up the same as I was they&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave been a lot
      better than wot I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bid Mr. Bunnett good-bye becos &lsquo;e said he&rsquo;d got to get back to &lsquo;is
      work, and Mr. Bunnett had &lsquo;ardly got &lsquo;ome afore Henery Walker turned up
      full of anxiousness to ask his advice about five little baby kittens wot
      &lsquo;is old cat had found in the wash-place: the night afore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Drownd them little innercent things, same as most would do, I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he
      ses, shaking his &lsquo;ead; &lsquo;but wot to do with &lsquo;em I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you find &lsquo;omes for &lsquo;em?&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henery Walker shook his &lsquo;ead agin. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use thinking o&rsquo; that,&rsquo; he
      ses. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s more cats than &lsquo;omes about &lsquo;ere&rsquo;. Why, Bill Chambers
      drownded six o&rsquo;ny last week right afore the eyes of my pore little boy.
      Upset &lsquo;im dreadful it did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bunnett walked up and down the room thinking. &lsquo;We must try and find
      &lsquo;omes for &lsquo;em when they are old enough,&rsquo; he says at last; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go round
      myself and see wot I can do for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henery Walker thanked &lsquo;im and went off &lsquo;ome doing a bit o&rsquo; thinking; and
      well he &lsquo;ad reason to. Everybody wanted one o&rsquo; them kittens. Peter Gubbins
      offered for to take two, and Mr. Bunnett told Henery Walker next day that
      &lsquo;e could ha&rsquo; found &lsquo;omes for &lsquo;em ten times over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea wot fine, kind-&rsquo;arted people they are in this village
      when their &lsquo;arts are touched,&rsquo; he ses, smiling at Henery. &lsquo;You ought to
      &lsquo;ave seen Mr. Jones&rsquo;s smile when I asked &lsquo;im to take one. It did me good
      to see it. And I spoke to Mr. Chambers about drowning &lsquo;is kittens, and he
      told me &lsquo;e hadn&rsquo;t slept a wink ever since. And he offered to take your old
      cat to make up for it, if you was tired of keeping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very &lsquo;ard on Henery Walker, I must say that. Other people was
      getting the credit of bringing up &lsquo;is kittens, and more than that, they
      used to ask Mr. Bunnett into their places to see &lsquo;ow the little dears was
      a-getting on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindness to animals caused more unpleasantness in Claybury than anything
      &lsquo;ad ever done afore. There was hardly a man as &lsquo;ud speak civil to each
      other, and the wimmen was a&rsquo;most as bad. Cats and dogs and such-like began
      to act as if the place belonged to &lsquo;em, and seven people stopped Mr.
      Bunnett one day to tell &lsquo;im that Joe Parsons &lsquo;ad been putting down
      rat-poison and killed five little baby rats and their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some time afore anybody knew that Bob Pretty &lsquo;ad got &lsquo;is eye on
      that gold watch, and when they did they could &lsquo;ardly believe it. They give
      Bob credit for too much sense to waste time over wot they knew &lsquo;e couldn&rsquo;t
      get, but arter they &lsquo;ad heard one or two things they got alarmed, and
      pretty near the whole village went up to see Mr. Bunnett and tell &lsquo;im
      about Bob&rsquo;s true character. Mr. Bunnett couldn&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;em at fast, but
      arter they &lsquo;ad told &lsquo;im of Bob&rsquo;s poaching and the artful ways and tricks
      he &lsquo;ad of getting money as didn&rsquo;t belong to &lsquo;im &lsquo;e began to think
      different. He spoke to parson about &lsquo;im, and arter that &lsquo;e said he never
      wanted for to see Bob Pretty&rsquo;s face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a fine to-do about it up at this &lsquo;ere Cauliflower public-&rsquo;ouse
      that night, and the quietest man &lsquo;o the whole lot was Bob Pretty. He sat
      still all the time drinking &lsquo;is beer and smiling at &lsquo;em and giving &lsquo;em
      good advice &lsquo;ow to get that gold watch.

    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow you could ever &lsquo;ave thought you &lsquo;ad a chance, Bob, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; ses

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow&rsquo;s the toad, Bob?&rsquo; ses Bill Chambers; and then they all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Laugh away, mates,&rsquo; ses Bob; &lsquo;I know you don&rsquo;t mean it. The on&rsquo;y thing
      I&rsquo;m sorry for is you can&rsquo;t all &lsquo;ave the gold watch, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve
      worked &lsquo;ard enough for it; keeping Henery Walker&rsquo;s kittens for &lsquo;im, and
      hanging round Mr. Bunnett&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve all got a better chance than wot you &lsquo;ave, Bob,&rsquo; ses little Dicky
      Weed the tailor.

    <p>
      &ldquo;The quietest man o&rsquo; the whole lot was Bob Pretty&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s your iggernerance, Dicky,&rsquo; ses Bob. &lsquo;Come to think it over
      quiet like, I&rsquo;m afraid I shall win it arter all. Cos why? Cos I deserves
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all laughed agin, and Bill Chambers laughed so &lsquo;arty that &lsquo;e joggled
      Peter Gubbins&rsquo;s arm and upset &lsquo;is beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Laugh away,&rsquo; ses Bob, pretending to get savage. &lsquo;Them that laughs best
      laughs last, mind. I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave that watch now, just to spite you all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow are you going to get it, Bob?&rsquo; ses Sam Jones, jeering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never you mind, mate,&rsquo; ses Bob, stamping &lsquo;is foot; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to win it
      fair. I&rsquo;m going to &lsquo;ave it for kindness to pore dumb animals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ear! &lsquo;ear!&rsquo; ses Dicky Weed, winking at the others. &lsquo;Will you &lsquo;ave a bet
      on it, Bob?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses Bob Pretty; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to win no man&rsquo;s money. I like to earn
      my money in the sweat o&rsquo; my brow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t win it, Bob,&rsquo; ses Dicky, grinning. &lsquo;Look &lsquo;ere! I&rsquo;ll lay
      you a level bob you don&rsquo;t get it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob shook his &lsquo;ead, and started talking to Bill Chambers about something
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you two bob to one, Bob,&rsquo; ses Dicky. &lsquo;Well, three to one,
      then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob sat up and looked at&rsquo;im for a long time, considering, and at last he
      ses, &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;if Smith the landlord will mind the money I
      will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;anded over his shilling,&rsquo; but very slow-like, and Dicky Weed &lsquo;anded
      over &lsquo;is money. Arter that Bob sat looking disagreeable like, especially
      when. Dicky said wot &lsquo;e was goin&rsquo; to do with the money, and by an by Sam
      Jones dared &lsquo;im to &lsquo;ave the same bet with &lsquo;im in sixpences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Pretty &lsquo;ad a pint more beer to think it over, and arter Bill Chambers
      &lsquo;ad stood &lsquo;im another, he said &lsquo;e would. He seemed a bit dazed like, and
      by the time he went &lsquo;ome he &lsquo;ad made bets with thirteen of &lsquo;em. Being
      Saturday night they &lsquo;ad all got money on &lsquo;em, and, as for Bob, he always
      &lsquo;ad some. Smith took care of the money and wrote it all up on a slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you &lsquo;ave a bit on, Mr. Smith?&rsquo; ses Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I dunno,&rsquo; ses Smith, wiping down the bar with a wet cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the chance of a lifetime,&rsquo; ses Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Looks like it,&rsquo; ses Smith, coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But &lsquo;e can&rsquo;t win,&rsquo; ses Sam Jones, looking a bit upset. &lsquo;Why, Mr. Bunnett
      said &lsquo;e ought to be locked up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been led away,&rsquo; ses Bob Pretty, shaking his &lsquo;ead. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a
      kind-&rsquo;arted old gen&rsquo;leman when &lsquo;e&rsquo;s left alone, and he&rsquo;ll soon see wot a
      mistake &lsquo;e&rsquo;s made about me. I&rsquo;ll show &lsquo;im. But I wish it was something
      more useful than a gold watch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t got it yet,&rsquo; ses Bill Chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, mate,&rsquo; ses Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you stand to lose a sight o&rsquo; money,&rsquo; ses Sam Jones. &lsquo;If you like,
      Bob Pretty, you can &lsquo;ave your bet back with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind, Sam,&rsquo; ses Bob; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t take no advantage of you. If I lose
      you&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave sixpence to buy a rabbit-hutch with. Good-night, mates all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He rumpled Bill Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;air for &lsquo;im as he passed&mdash;a thing Bill
      never can a-bear&mdash;and gave Henery Walker, wot was drinking beer, a
      smack on the back wot nearly ruined &lsquo;im for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of &lsquo;em went and told Mr. Bunnett some more things about Bob next
      day, but they might as well ha&rsquo; saved their breath. The old gen&rsquo;leman said
      he knew all about &lsquo;im and he never wanted to &lsquo;ear his name mentioned agin.
      Arter which they began for to &lsquo;ave a more cheerful way of looking at
      things; and Sam Jones said &lsquo;e was going to &lsquo;ave a hole bored through &lsquo;is
      sixpence and wear it round &lsquo;is neck to aggravate Bob Pretty with.

    <p>
      &ldquo;For the next three or four weeks Bob Pretty seemed to keep very quiet,
      and we all began to think as &lsquo;ow he &lsquo;ad made a mistake for once. Everybody
      else was trying their &lsquo;ardest for the watch, and all Bob done was to make
      a laugh of &lsquo;em and to say he believed it was on&rsquo;y made of brass arter all.
      Then one arternoon, just a few days afore Mr. Bunnett&rsquo;s time was up at the
      farm, Bob took &lsquo;is dog out for a walk, and arter watching the farm for
      some time met the old gen&rsquo;leman by accident up at Coe&rsquo;s plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good arternoon, sir,&rsquo; he ses, smiling at &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Wot wunnerful fine
      weather we&rsquo;re a-having for the time o&rsquo; year. I&rsquo;ve just brought Joseph out
      for a bit of a walk. He ain&rsquo;t been wot I might call hisself for the last
      day or two, and I thought a little fresh air might do &lsquo;im good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bunnett just looked at him, and then &lsquo;e passed &lsquo;im by without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wanted to ask your advice about &lsquo;im,&rsquo; ses Bob, turning round and
      follering of &lsquo;im. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a delikit animal, and sometimes I wonder whether I
      &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t been a-pampering of &lsquo;im too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go away,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;eard all about you. Go away at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Heard all about me?&rsquo; ses Bob Pretty, looking puzzled. &lsquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t
      &lsquo;ave heard no &lsquo;arm, that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been told your true character,&rsquo; ses the old gen&rsquo;leman, very firm.
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m ashamed that I should have let myself be deceived by you. I hope
      you&rsquo;ll try and do better while there is still time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If anybody &lsquo;as got anything to say agin my character,&rsquo; says Bob, &lsquo;I wish
      as they&rsquo;d say it to my face. I&rsquo;m a pore, hard-working man, and my
      character&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re poorer than you thought you was then,&rsquo; says Mr. Bunnett. &lsquo;I wish
      you good arternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good arternoon, sir,&rsquo; ses Bob, very humble. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid some on &lsquo;em &lsquo;ave
      been telling lies about me, and I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d got a enemy in the
      world. Come on, Joseph. Come on, old pal. We ain&rsquo;t wanted here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shook &lsquo;is &lsquo;ead with sorrow, and made a little sucking noise between
      &lsquo;is teeth, and afore you could wink, his dog &lsquo;ad laid hold of the old
      gen&rsquo;leman&rsquo;s leg and kep&rsquo; quiet waiting orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Help!&rsquo; screams Mr. Bunnett. &lsquo;Call, &lsquo;im off! Call &lsquo;im off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob said arterwards that &lsquo;e was foolish enough to lose &lsquo;is presence o&rsquo; 
      mind for a moment, and instead o&rsquo; doing anything he stood there gaping
      with &lsquo;is mouth open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call &lsquo;im off!&rsquo; screams Mr. Bunnett, trying to push the dog away. &lsquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you call him off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rsquo; ses Bob Pretty in a frightened voice. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t move, wotever
      you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call him off! Take &lsquo;im away!&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Joseph! Joseph! Wotever are you a-thinking of?&rsquo; ses Bob, shaking
      &lsquo;is &lsquo;ead at the dog. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you! Don&rsquo;t you know Mr. Bunnett wot
      is so fond of animals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t call &lsquo;im off, ses Mr. Bunnett, trembling all over, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      have you locked up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am a-calling &lsquo;im off,&rsquo; ses Bob, looking very puzzled. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you &lsquo;ear
      me? It&rsquo;s you making that noise that excites &lsquo;im, I think. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps if you
      keep quiet he&rsquo;ll leave go. Come off, Joseph, old boy, there&rsquo;s a good
      doggie. That ain&rsquo;t a bone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking to &lsquo;im like that,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett, keeping quiet
      but trembling worse than ever. &lsquo;Make him let go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;urt his feelings,&rsquo; ses Bob; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve got their feelings
      the same as wot we &lsquo;ave. Besides, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;is fault&mdash;
      p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;s gone mad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;HELP!&rsquo; ses the old gen&rsquo;leman, in a voice that might ha&rsquo; been heard a
      mile away. &lsquo;HELP!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep quiet?&rsquo; ses Bob. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re on&rsquo;y frightening the pore
      animal and making things worse. Joseph, leave go and I&rsquo;ll see whether
      there&rsquo;s a biskit in my pocket. Why don&rsquo;t you leave go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pull him off. Hit &lsquo;im,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett, shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot?&rsquo; ses Bob Pretty, with a start. &lsquo;Hit a poor, dumb animal wot don&rsquo;t
      know no better! Why, you&rsquo;d never forgive me, sir, and I should lose the
      gold watch besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett, speaking very fast. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave as
      much chance of it as ever you had. Hit &lsquo;im! Quick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It &lsquo;ud break my &lsquo;art,&rsquo; ses Bob. &lsquo;He&rsquo;d never forgive me; but if you&rsquo;ll
      take the responserbility, and then go straight &lsquo;ome and give me the gold
      watch now for kindness to animals, I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shook his &lsquo;ead with sorrow and made that sucking noise agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right, you shall &lsquo;ave it,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett, shouting. &lsquo;You shall
      &lsquo;ave it.&rsquo;

      &ldquo;&lsquo;For kindness to animals?&rsquo; ses Bob. &lsquo;Honour bright?&rsquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Mr. Bunnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Pretty lifted &lsquo;is foot and caught Joseph one behind that surprised
      &lsquo;im. Then he &lsquo;elped Mr. Bunnett look at &lsquo;is leg, and arter pointing out
      that the skin wasn&rsquo;t hardly broken, and saying that Joseph &lsquo;ad got the
      best mouth of any dog in Claybury, &lsquo;e walked &lsquo;ome with the old gen&rsquo;leman
      and got the watch. He said Mr. Bunnett made a little speech when &lsquo;e gave
      it to &lsquo;im wot he couldn&rsquo;t remember, and wot he wouldn&rsquo;t repeat if &lsquo;e
      could.

      THE BEQUEST
    </h1>

    </p>
    <p>
      R. Robert Clarkson sat by his fire, smoking thoughtfully. His lifelong
      neighbour and successful rival in love had passed away a few days before,
      and Mr. Clarkson, fresh from the obsequies, sat musing on the fragility of
      man and the inconvenience that sometimes attended his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His meditations were disturbed by a low knocking on the front door, which
      opened on to the street. In response to his invitation it opened slowly,
      and a small middle-aged man of doleful aspect entered softly and closed it
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Bob,&rdquo; he said, in stricken accents. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just step
      round to see how you was bearing up. Fancy pore old Phipps! Why, I&rsquo;d
      a&rsquo;most as soon it had been me. A&rsquo;most.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here to-day and gone to-morrow,&rdquo; continued Mr. Smithson, taking a seat.
      &ldquo;Well, well! So you&rsquo;ll have her at last-pore thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was his wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, in a dull voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very generous of him too,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson. &ldquo;Everybody is saying
      so. Certainly he couldn&rsquo;t take her away with him. How long is it since you
      was both of you courting her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty years come June,&rdquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shows what waiting does, and patience,&rdquo; commented Mr. Smithson. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d
      been like some chaps and gone abroad, where would you have been now? Where
      would have been the reward of your faithful heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson, whose pipe had gone out, took a coal from the fire and lit
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand him dying at his age,&rdquo; he said, darkly. &ldquo;He ought to
      have lived to ninety if he&rsquo;d been taken care of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone, pore chap,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;What a blessing it must
      ha&rsquo; been to him in his last moments to think that he had made provision
      for his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provision!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Clarkson. &ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s left her nothing but the
      furniture and fifty pounds insurance money&mdash;nothing in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson fidgeted. &ldquo;I mean you,&rdquo; he said, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t want you to eat your heart out in waiting,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Smithson. &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind about me,&rsquo; he said to her; &lsquo;you go and make Bob
      happy.&rsquo; Wonderful pretty girl she used to be, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Mr. Clarkson
      assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve no doubt she looks the same to you as ever she did,&rdquo; pursued the
      sentimental Mr. Smithson. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the extraordinary part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson turned and eyed him; removed the pipe from his mouth, and,
      after hesitating a moment, replaced it with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she&rsquo;d rather be faithful to his memory,&rdquo; continued the
      persevering Mr. Smithson, &ldquo;but his wishes are her law. She said so to my
      missis only yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, she ought to be considered,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;I think that somebody ought to put it to her. She has got her feelings,
      poor thing, and, if she would rather not marry again, she oughtn&rsquo;t to be
      compelled to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what my missis did say to her,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;but she didn&rsquo;t pay
      much attention. She said it was Henry&rsquo;s wish and she didn&rsquo;t care what
      happened to her now he&rsquo;s gone. Besides, if you come to think of it, what
      else is she to do? Don&rsquo;t you worry, Bob; you won&rsquo;t lose her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson, staring at the fire, mused darkly. For thirty years he had
      played the congenial part of the disappointed admirer but faithful friend.
      He had intended to play it for at least fifty or sixty. He wished that he
      had had the strength of mind to refuse the bequest when the late Mr.
      Phipps first mentioned it, or taken a firmer line over the congratulations
      of his friends. As it was, Little Molton quite understood that after
      thirty years&rsquo; waiting the faithful heart was to be rewarded at last.
      Public opinion seemed to be that the late Mr. Phipps had behaved with
      extraordinary generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather late in life for me to begin,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; said the cheerful Mr. Smithson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And something seems to tell me that I ain&rsquo;t long for this world,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Clarkson, eyeing him with some disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lose all them ideas as
      soon as you&rsquo;re married. You&rsquo;ll have somebody to look after you and help
      you spend your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson emitted a dismal groan, and clapping his hand over his mouth
      strove to make it pass muster as a yawn. It was evident that the malicious
      Mr. Smithson was deriving considerable pleasure from his discomfiture&mdash;the
      pleasure natural to the father of seven over the troubles of a comfortable
      bachelor. Mr. Clarkson, anxious to share his troubles with somebody, came
      to a sudden and malicious determination to share them with Mr. Smithson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody to help me spend my money,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;First
      and last I&rsquo;ve saved a tidy bit. I&rsquo;ve got this house, those three cottages
      in Turner&rsquo;s Lane, and pretty near six hundred pounds in the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson&rsquo;s eyes glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought&mdash;it had occurred to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, trying to
      keep as near the truth as possible, &ldquo;to leave my property to a friend o&rsquo; 
      mine &mdash;a hard-working man with a large family. However, it&rsquo;s no use
      talking about that now. It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who was it?&rdquo; inquired his friend, trying to keep his voice
      steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking about that now,
      George,&rdquo; he said, eyeing him with sly enjoyment. &ldquo;I shall have to leave
      everything to my wife now. After all, perhaps it does more harm than good
      to leave money to people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, sharply. &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, George,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said the other, with a gasp. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; He jumped up from his chair, and,
      seizing the other&rsquo;s hand, shook it fervently.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have told you, George,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, with great
      satisfaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only make you miserable. It&rsquo;s just one o&rsquo; the might
      ha&rsquo; beens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson, with his back to the fire and his hands twisted behind him,
      stood with his eyes fixed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather cool of Phipps,&rdquo; he said, after a long silence; &ldquo;rather cool,
      I think, to go out of the world and just leave his wife to you to look
      after. Some men wouldn&rsquo;t stand it. You&rsquo;re too easy-going, Bob, that&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s the matter with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get took advantage of,&rdquo; added his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to talk,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, &ldquo;but what can I do? I
      ought to have spoke up at the time. It&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was you,&rdquo; said his friend very earnestly, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t want to marry
      her, I should tell her so. Say what you like it ain&rsquo;t fair to her you
      know. It ain&rsquo;t fair to the pore woman. She&rsquo;d never forgive you if she
      found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s taking it for granted,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let everybody look after their own business,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, tartly.
      &ldquo;Now, look here, Bob; suppose I get you out of this business, how am I to
      be sure you&rsquo;ll leave your property to me?&mdash;not that I want it.
      Suppose you altered your will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get me out of it, every penny I leave will go to you,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Clarkson, fervently. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any relations, and it don&rsquo;t matter in
      the slightest to me who has it after I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as you stand there?&rdquo; demanded the other, eyeing him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as I stand here,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, smiting his chest, and shook
      hands again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after his visitor had gone he sat gazing in a brooding fashion at the
      fire. As a single man his wants were few, and he could live on his
      savings; as the husband of Mrs. Phipps he would be compelled to resume the
      work he thought he had dropped for good three years before. Moreover, Mrs.
      Phipps possessed a strength of character that had many times caused him to
      congratulate himself upon her choice of a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly but surely his fetters were made secure. Two days later the widow
      departed to spend six weeks with a sister; but any joy that he might have
      felt over the circumstance was marred by the fact that he had to carry her
      bags down to the railway station and see her off. The key of her house was
      left with him, with strict injunctions to go in and water her geraniums
      every day, while two canaries and a bullfinch had to be removed to his own
      house in order that they might have constant attention and company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing it on purpose,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, fiercely; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s binding
      you hand and foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson assented gloomily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trusting to you, George,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it be to forget to water the geraniums and let the birds die
      because they missed her so much?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Smithson, after prolonged
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a hint,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson took some letters from the mantelpiece and held them up. &ldquo;She
      writes about them every day,&rdquo; he said, briefly, &ldquo;and I have to answer
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she don&rsquo;t refer to your getting married, I suppose?&rdquo; said his
      friend, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson said &ldquo;No. But her sister does,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had two
      letters from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson got up and paced restlessly up and down the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      women all over,&rdquo; he said, bitterly. &ldquo;They never ask for things straight
      out; but they always get &lsquo;em in roundabout ways. She can&rsquo;t do it herself,
      so she gets her sister to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson groaned. &ldquo;And her sister is hinting that she can&rsquo;t leave the
      house where she spent so many happy years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and says what a
      pleasant surprise it would be for Mrs. Phipps if she was to come home and
      find it done up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you&rsquo;ve got to live there when you&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; said his
      friend, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson glanced round his comfortable room and groaned again. &ldquo;She
      asked me to get an estimate from Digson,&rdquo; he said, dully. &ldquo;She knows as
      well as I do her sister hasn&rsquo;t got any money. I wrote to say that it had
      better be left till she comes home, as I might not know what was wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson nodded approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Phipps wrote herself and thanked me for being so considerate,&rdquo;
       continued his friend, grimly, &ldquo;and says that when she comes back we must
      go over the house together and see what wants doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson got up and walked round the room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never promised to marry her?&rdquo; he said, stopping suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been arranged for me. I never said a word.
      I couldn&rsquo;t tell Phipps I wouldn&rsquo;t have her with them all standing round,
      and him thinking he was doing me the greatest favour in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t name the day unless you ask her,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;All
      you&rsquo;ve got to do is to keep quiet and not commit yourself. Be as cool as
      you can, and, just before she comes home, you go off to London on business
      and stay there as long as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson carried out his instructions to the letter, and Mrs. Phipps,
      returning home at the end of her visit, learned that he had left for
      London three days before, leaving the geraniums and birds to the care of
      Mr. Smithson. From the hands of that unjust steward she received two empty
      bird-cages, together with a detailed account of the manner in which the
      occupants had effected their escape, and a bullfinch that seemed to be
      suffering from torpid liver. The condition of the geraniums was ascribed
      to worms in the pots, frost, and premature decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go like it sometimes,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, &ldquo;and when they do nothing
      will save &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Phipps thanked him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to take so much trouble,&rdquo;
       she said, quietly; &ldquo;some people would have lost the cages too while they
      were about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, in a surly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Phipps, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and I am sure I am much
      obliged to you. If there is anything of yours I can look after at any time
      I shall be only too pleased. When did you say Mr. Clarkson was coming
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, promptly. &ldquo;He might be away a month;
      and then, again, he might be away six. It all depends. You know what
      business is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very thoughtful of him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Phipps. &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoughtful!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Smithson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone away for a time out of consideration for me,&rdquo; said the widow.
      &ldquo;As things are, it is a little bit awkward for us to meet much at
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gone away for that at all,&rdquo; said the other, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Phipps shook her head. &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know him as well as I do,&rdquo; she
      said, fondly. &ldquo;He has gone away on my account, I feel sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson screwed his lips together and remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he feels that it is right and proper for him to come back,&rdquo; pursued
      Mrs. Phipps, turning her eyes upwards, &ldquo;he will come. He has left his
      comfortable home just for my sake, and I shall not forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson coughed-a short, dry cough, meant to convey incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not do anything to this house till he comes back,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Phipps. &ldquo;I expect he would like to have a voice in it. He always used to
      admire it and say how comfortable it was. Well, well, we never know what
      is before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson repeated the substance of the interview to Mr. Clarkson by
      letter, and in the lengthy correspondence that followed kept him posted as
      to the movements of Mrs. Phipps. By dint of warnings and entreaties he
      kept the bridegroom-elect in London for three months. By that time Little
      Molton was beginning to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beginning to see how the land lays,&rdquo; said Mr. Smithson, on the
      evening of his friend&rsquo;s return, &ldquo;and if you keep quiet and do as I tell
      you she&rsquo;ll begin to see it too. As I said before, she can&rsquo;t name the day
      till you ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson agreed, and the following morning, when he called upon Mrs.
      Phipps at her request, his manner was so distant that she attributed it to
      ill-health following business worries and the atmosphere of London. In the
      front parlour Mr. Digson, a small builder and contractor, was busy
      whitewashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we might as well get on with that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Phipps; &ldquo;there is
      only one way of doing whitewashing, and the room has got to be done.
      To-morrow Mr. Digson will bring up some papers, and, if you&rsquo;ll come round,
      you can help me choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson hesitated. &ldquo;Why not choose &lsquo;em yourself?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I told her,&rdquo; said Mr. Digson, stroking his black beard.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll please you will be sure to please him, I says; and if it don&rsquo;t it
      ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link017" id="link017"></a> <br /><br />

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="017.jpg (130K)" src="images/017.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson started. &ldquo;Perhaps you could help her choose,&rdquo; he said,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digson came down from his perch. &ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If
      Mrs. Phipps will let me advise her, I&rsquo;ll make this house so she won&rsquo;t know
      it before I&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Digson has been very kind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Phipps, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the builder, softly. &ldquo;Anything I can do to make
      you happy or comfortable will be a pleasure to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson started again, and an odd idea sent his blood dancing. Digson
      was a widower; Mrs. Phipps was a widow. Could anything be more suitable or
      desirable?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better let him choose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all, he ought to be a good
      judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Phipps, after a faint protest, gave way, and Mr. Digson, smiling
      broadly, mounted his perch again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson&rsquo;s first idea was to consult Mr. Smithson; then he resolved to
      wait upon events. The idea was fantastic to begin with, but, if things did
      take such a satisfactory turn, he could not help reflecting that it would
      not be due to any efforts on the part of Mr. Smithson, and he would no
      longer be under any testamentary obligations to that enterprising
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of a week he was jubilant. A child could have told Mr. Digson&rsquo;s
      intentions&mdash;and Mrs. Phipps was anything but a child. Mr. Clarkson
      admitted cheerfully that Mr. Digson was a younger and better-looking man
      than himself&mdash;a more suitable match in every way. And, so far as he
      could judge, Mrs. Phipps seemed to think so. At any rate, she had ceased
      to make the faintest allusion to any tie between them. He left her one day
      painting a door, while the attentive Digson guided the brush, and walked
      homewards smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Bignell,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;when is it to be?&rdquo; inquired his friend, walking beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson frowned. &ldquo;When is what to be?&rdquo; he demanded, disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bignell lowered his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lose her if you ain&rsquo;t careful,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Mark my words. Can&rsquo;t you see Digson&rsquo;s little game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s after her money,&rdquo; said the other, with a cautious glance around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; said the other, with an astonished laugh. &ldquo;Why, she hasn&rsquo;t got
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Bignell. &ldquo;You know best of course. I was just
      giving you the tip, but if you know better&mdash;why, there&rsquo;s nothing more
      to be said. She&rsquo;ll be riding in her carriage and pair in six months,
      anyhow; the richest woman in Little Molton.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson stopped short and eyed him in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Digson got a bit sprung one night and told me,&rdquo; said Mr. Bignell. &ldquo;She
      don&rsquo;t know it herself yet&mdash;uncle on her mother&rsquo;s side in America. She
      might know at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but how did Digson know?&rdquo; inquired the astonished Mr. Clarkson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s good enough for him. What
      do you think he&rsquo;s after? Her? And mind, don&rsquo;t let on to a soul that I told
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, leaving Mr. Clarkson standing in a dazed condition in the
      centre of the foot-path. Recovering himself by an effort, he walked slowly
      away, and, after prowling about for some time in an aimless fashion, made
      his way back to Mrs. Phipps&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He emerged an hour later an engaged man, with the date of the wedding
      fixed. With jaunty steps he walked round and put up the banns, and then,
      with the air of a man who has completed a successful stroke of business,
      walked homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Molton is a small town and news travels fast, but it did not travel
      faster than Mr. Smithson as soon as he had heard it. He burst into Mr.
      Clarkson&rsquo;s room like the proverbial hurricane, and, gasping for breath,
      leaned against the table and pointed at him an incriminating finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You you&rsquo;ve been running,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;what do you&mdash;mean by it?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Smithson.
      &ldquo;After all my trouble. After our&mdash;bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I altered my mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;Another day and I
      believe I should ha&rsquo; been too late. It took me pretty near an hour to talk
      her over. Said I&rsquo;d been neglecting her, and all that sort of thing; said
      that she was beginning to think I didn&rsquo;t want her. As hard a job as ever I
      had in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; said the amazed Mr. Smithson. &ldquo;You told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstood me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clarkson, coughing. &ldquo;You jump at
      conclusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson sat staring at him. &ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; he said at last, with an
      effort... &ldquo;I heard that Digson was paying her attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clarkson spoke without thought. &ldquo;Ha, he was only after her money,&rdquo; he
      said, severely. &ldquo;Good heavens! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson, who had sprung to his feet, made no reply, but stood for
      some time incapable of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;matter?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clarkson. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson swayed a little, and sank slowly back into his chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Room&rsquo;s too hot,&rdquo; said his astonished host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson, staring straight before him, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Clarkson, in the low tones of confidence,
      &ldquo;Digson was after her money. Of course her money don&rsquo;t make any difference
      to me, although, perhaps, I may be able to do something for friends like
      you. It&rsquo;s from an uncle in America on her mother&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smithson made a strange moaning noise, and, snatching his hat from the
      table, clapped it on his head and made for the door. Mr. Clarkson flung
      his arms around him and dragged him back by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you carrying on like that for?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What do you mean
      by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; returned Mr. Smithson, with intense bitterness. &ldquo;I thought Digson
      was the biggest fool in the place, and I find I&rsquo;ve made a mistake. So have
      you. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and dashed out. Mr. Clarkson, with a strange sinking at
      his heart, watched him up the road.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The night-watchman shook his head. &ldquo;I never met any of these phil&mdash;
      philantherpists, as you call &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he said, decidedly. &ldquo;If I &lsquo;ad they
      wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave got away from me in a hurry, I can tell you. I don&rsquo;t say I
      don&rsquo;t believe in &lsquo;em; I only say I never met any of &lsquo;em. If people do you
      a kindness it&rsquo;s generally because they want to get something out of you;
      same as a man once&mdash;a perfick stranger&mdash;wot stood me eight
      &lsquo;arf-pints becos I reminded &lsquo;im of his dead brother, and then borrered
      five bob off of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo; course, there must be some kind-&rsquo;arted people in the world&mdash;all
      men who get married must &lsquo;ave a soft spot somewhere, if it&rsquo;s only in the
      &lsquo;ead&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t often give things away. Kind-&rsquo;artedness is often
      only another name for artfulness, same as Sam Small&rsquo;s kindness to Ginger
      Dick and Peter Russet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It started with a row. They was just back from a v&rsquo;y&rsquo;ge and &lsquo;ad taken a
      nice room together in Wapping, and for the fust day or two, wot with
      &lsquo;aving plenty o&rsquo; money to spend and nothing to do, they was like three
      brothers. Then, in a little, old-fashioned public-&rsquo;ouse down Poplar way,
      one night they fell out over a little joke Ginger played on Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the fust drink that evening, and Sam &lsquo;ad just ordered a pot o&rsquo; 
      beer and three glasses, when Ginger winked at the landlord and offered to
      bet Sam a level &lsquo;arf-dollar that &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t drink off that pot o&rsquo; beer
      without taking breath. The landlord held the money, and old Sam, with a
      &lsquo;appy smile on &lsquo;is face, &lsquo;ad just taken up the mug, when he noticed the
      odd way in which they was all watching him. Twice he took the mug up and
      put it down agin without starting and asked &lsquo;em wot the little game was,
      but they on&rsquo;y laughed. He took it up the third time and started, and he
      &lsquo;ad just got about &lsquo;arf-way through when Ginger turns to the landlord and
      ses&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you catch it in the mouse-trap,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;or did it die of poison?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pore Sam started as though he &lsquo;ad been shot, and, arter getting rid of
      the beer in &lsquo;is mouth, stood there &lsquo;olding the mug away from &lsquo;im and
      making such &lsquo;orrible faces that they was a&rsquo;most frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter with him? I&rsquo;ve never seen &lsquo;im carry on like that over a
      drop of beer before,&rsquo; ses Ginger, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He usually likes it,&rsquo; ses Peter Russet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not with a dead mouse in it,&rsquo; ses Sam, trembling with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mouse?&rsquo; ses Ginger, innercent-like. &lsquo;Mouse? Why, I didn&rsquo;t say it was in
      your beer, Sam. Wotever put that into your &lsquo;ead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And made you lose your bet,&rsquo; ses Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then old Sam see &lsquo;ow he&rsquo;d been done, and the way he carried on when the
      landlord gave Ginger the &lsquo;arf-dollar, and said it was won fair and honest,
      was a disgrace. He &lsquo;opped about that bar &lsquo;arf crazy, until at last the
      landlord and &lsquo;is brother, and a couple o&rsquo; soldiers, and a helpless cripple
      wot wos selling matches, put &lsquo;im outside and told &lsquo;im to stop there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stopped there till Ginger and Peter came out, and then, drawing
      &lsquo;imself up in a proud way, he told &lsquo;em their characters and wot he thought
      about &lsquo;em. And he said &lsquo;e never wanted to see wot they called their faces
      agin as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done with you,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;both of you, for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; ses Ginger moving off. &lsquo;Ta-ta for the present. Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope
      he&rsquo;ll come &lsquo;ome in a better temper, Peter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ome?&rsquo; ses Sam, with a nasty laugh, &ldquo;&lsquo;ome? D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m coming back to
      breathe the same air as you, Ginger? D&rsquo;ye think I want to be suffocated?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He held his &lsquo;ead up very &lsquo;igh, and, arter looking at them as if they was
      dirt, he turned round and walked off with his nose in the air to spend the
      evening by &lsquo;imself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His temper kept him up for a time, but arter a while he &lsquo;ad to own up to
      &lsquo;imself that it was very dull, and the later it got the more he thought of
      &lsquo;is nice warm bed. The more &lsquo;e thought of it the nicer and warmer it
      seemed, and, arter a struggle between his pride and a few &lsquo;arf-pints, he
      got &lsquo;is good temper back agin and went off &lsquo;ome smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room was dark when &lsquo;e got there, and, arter standing listening a
      moment to Ginger and Peter snoring, he took off &lsquo;is coat and sat down on
      &lsquo;is bed to take &lsquo;is boots off. He only sat down for a flash, and then he
      bent down and hit his &lsquo;ead an awful smack against another &lsquo;ead wot &lsquo;ad
      just started up to see wot it was sitting on its legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought it was Peter or Ginger in the wrong bed at fust, but afore he
      could make it out Ginger &lsquo;ad got out of &lsquo;is own bed and lit the candle.
      Then &lsquo;e saw it was a stranger in &lsquo;is bed, and without saying a word he
      laid &lsquo;old of him by the &lsquo;air and began dragging him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here, stop that!&rsquo; ses Ginger catching hold of &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Lend a hand &lsquo;ere,
      Peter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter lent a hand and screwed it into the back o&rsquo; Sam&rsquo;s neck till he made
      &lsquo;im leave go, and then the stranger, a nasty-looking little chap with a
      yellow face and a little dark moustache, told Sam wot he&rsquo;d like to do to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; ses Sam, &lsquo;and wot are you a-doing of in my bed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s our lodger,&rsquo; ses Ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your wot?&rsquo; ses Sam, &lsquo;ardly able to believe his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Our lodger,&rsquo; ses Peter Russet. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve let &lsquo;im the bed you said you
      didn&rsquo;t want for sixpence a night. Now you take yourself off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Sam couldn&rsquo;t speak for a minute; there was no words that he knew bad
      enough, but at last he licks &lsquo;is lips and he ses, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve paid for that bed
      up to Saturday, and I&rsquo;m going to have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He rushed at the lodger, but Peter and Ginger got hold of &lsquo;im agin and
      put &lsquo;im down on the floor and sat on &lsquo;im till he promised to be&rsquo;ave
      himself. They let &lsquo;im get up at last, and then, arter calling themselves
      names for their kind-&rsquo;artedness, they said if he was very good he might
      sleep on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam looked at &lsquo;em for a moment, and then, without a word, he took off &lsquo;is
      boots and put on &lsquo;is coat and went up in a corner to be out of the
      draught, but, wot with the cold and &lsquo;is temper, and the hardness of the
      floor, it was a long time afore &lsquo;e could get to sleep. He dropped off at
      last, and it seemed to &lsquo;im that he &lsquo;ad only just closed &lsquo;is eyes when it
      was daylight. He opened one eye and was just going to open the other when
      he saw something as made &lsquo;im screw &lsquo;em both up sharp and peep through &lsquo;is
      eyelashes. The lodger was standing at the foot o&rsquo; Ginger&rsquo;s bed, going
      through &lsquo;is pockets, and then, arter waiting a moment and &lsquo;aving a look
      round, he went through Peter Russet&rsquo;s. Sam lay still mouse while the
      lodger tip-toed out o&rsquo; the room with &lsquo;is boots in his &lsquo;and, and then,
      springing up, follered him downstairs.

      &ldquo;He caught &lsquo;im up just as he &lsquo;ad undone the front door, and, catching hold
      of &lsquo;im by the back o&rsquo; the neck, shook &lsquo;im till &lsquo;e was tired. Then he let
      go of &lsquo;im and, holding his fist under &lsquo;is nose, told &lsquo;im to hand over the
      money, and look sharp about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, sir,&rsquo; ses the lodger, who was &lsquo;arf choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam held out his &lsquo;and, and the lodger, arter saying it was only a little
      bit o&rsquo; fun on &lsquo;is part, and telling &lsquo;im wot a fancy he &lsquo;ad taken to &lsquo;im
      from the fust, put Ginger&rsquo;s watch and chain into his &lsquo;ands and eighteen
      pounds four shillings and sevenpence. Sam put it into his pocket, and,
      arter going through the lodger&rsquo;s pockets to make sure he &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t forgot
      anything, opened the door and flung &lsquo;im into the street. He stopped on the
      landing to put the money in a belt he was wearing under &lsquo;is clothes, and
      then &lsquo;e went back on tip-toe to &lsquo;is corner and went to sleep with one eye
      open and the &lsquo;appiest smile that had been on his face for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shut both eyes when he &lsquo;eard Ginger wake up, and he slept like a child
      through the &lsquo;orrible noise that Peter and Ginger see fit to make when they
      started to put their clothes on. He got tired of it afore they did, and,
      arter opening &lsquo;is eyes slowly and yawning, he asked Ginger wot he meant by
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll wake your lodger up if you ain&rsquo;t careful, making that noise,&rsquo; he
      ses. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; ses Ginger, in a very different voice to wot he &lsquo;ad used the night
      before, &lsquo;Sam, old pal, he&rsquo;s taken all our money and bolted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot?&rsquo; ses Sam, sitting up on the floor and blinking, &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Robbed me and Peter,&rsquo; ses Ginger, in a trembling voice; &lsquo;taken every
      penny we&rsquo;ve got, and my watch and chain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming,&rsquo; ses Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wish I was,&rsquo; ses Ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But surely, Ginger,&rsquo; ses Sam, standing up, &lsquo;surely you didn&rsquo;t take a
      lodger without a character?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He seemed such a nice chap,&rsquo; ses Peter. &lsquo;We was only saying wot a much
      nicer chap he was than&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go on, Peter,&rsquo; ses Sam, very perlite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Than he might ha&rsquo; been,&rsquo; ses Ginger, very quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad a wonderful escape,&rsquo; ses Sam. &lsquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been for
      sleeping in my clothes I suppose he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; &lsquo;ad my money as well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He felt in &lsquo;is pockets anxious-like, then he smiled, and stood there
      letting &lsquo;is money fall through &lsquo;is fingers into his pocket over and over
      agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pore chap,&rsquo; he ses; &lsquo;pore chap; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;d got a starving wife and
      family. Who knows? It ain&rsquo;t for us to judge &lsquo;im, Ginger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stood a little while longer chinking &lsquo;is money, and when he took off
      his coat to wash Ginger Dick poured the water out for im and Peter Russet
      picked up the soap, which &lsquo;ad fallen on the floor. Then they started
      pitying themselves, looking very &lsquo;ard at the back of old Sam while they
      did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ve got to starve, Peter,&rsquo; ses Ginger, in, a sad voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Looks like it,&rsquo; ses Peter, dressing hisself very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;ll mourn for me, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rsquo; ses Ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Or me,&rsquo; ses Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Sam&rsquo;ll miss us a bit,&rsquo; ses Ginger, grinding &lsquo;is teeth as old Sam
      went on washing as if he was deaf. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ss the only real pal we ever &lsquo;ad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot are you talking about?&rsquo; ses Sam, turning round with the soap in his
      eyes, and feeling for the towel. &lsquo;Wot d&rsquo;ye want to starve for? Why don&rsquo;t
      you get a ship?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought we was all going to sign on in the Cheaspeake agin, Sam,&rsquo; ses
      Ginger, very mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She won&rsquo;t be ready for sea for pretty near three weeks,&rsquo; ses Sam. &lsquo;You
      know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Sam would lend us a trifle to go on with, Ginger,&rsquo; ses Peter
      Russet. &lsquo;Just enough to keep body and soul together, so as we can hold out
      and &lsquo;ave the pleasure of sailing with &lsquo;im agin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; ses Sam, afore Ginger could open his mouth. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      just got about enough to last myself; I &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t got any to lend. Sailormen
      wot turns on their best friends and makes them sleep on the cold &lsquo;ard
      floor while their new pal is in his bed don&rsquo;t get money lent to &lsquo;em. My
      neck is so stiff it creaks every time I move it, and I&rsquo;ve got the
      rheumatics in my legs something cruel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He began to &lsquo;um a song, and putting on &lsquo;is cap went out to get some
      brekfuss. He went to a little eating-&rsquo;ouse near by, where they was in the
      &lsquo;abit of going, and &lsquo;ad just started on a plate of eggs and bacon when
      Ginger Dick and Peter came into the place with a pocket-&rsquo;ankercher of &lsquo;is
      wot they &lsquo;ad found in the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We thought you might want it, Sam,&rsquo; ses Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link020" id="link020"></a> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So we brought it along,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ope you&rsquo;re enjoying of your
      brekfuss, Sam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam took the &lsquo;ankercher and thanked &lsquo;em very perlite, and arter standing
      there for a minute or two as if they wanted to say something they couldn&rsquo;t
      remember, they sheered off. When Sam left the place &lsquo;arf-an-hour
      afterwards they was still hanging about, and as Sam passed Ginger asked
      &lsquo;im if he was going for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Walk?&rsquo; ses Sam. &lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly not. I&rsquo;m going to bed; I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave a good
      night&rsquo;s rest like you and your lodger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went back &lsquo;ome, and arter taking off &lsquo;is coat and boots got into bed
      and slept like a top till one o&rsquo;clock, when he woke up to find Ginger
      shaking &lsquo;im by the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Wot are you up to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s dinner-time,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;I thought p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d like to know, in
      case you missed it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You leave me alone,&rsquo; ses Sam, cuddling into the clothes agin. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      want no dinner. You go and look arter your own dinners.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stayed in bed for another &lsquo;arf-hour, listening to Peter and Ginger
      telling each other in loud whispers &lsquo;ow hungry they was, and then he got
      up and put &lsquo;is things on and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a bit o&rsquo; dinner,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;And mind, I&rsquo;ve got my pocket
      &lsquo;ankercher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went out and &lsquo;ad a steak and onions and a pint o&rsquo; beer, but, although
      he kept looking up sudden from &lsquo;is plate, he didn&rsquo;t see Peter or Ginger.
      It spoilt &lsquo;is dinner a bit, but arter he got outside &lsquo;e saw them standing
      at the corner, and, pretending not to see them, he went off for a walk
      down the Mile End Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He walked as far as Bow with them follering&rsquo;im, and then he jumped on a
      bus and rode back as far as Whitechapel. There was no sign of &lsquo;em when he
      got off, and, feeling a bit lonesome, he stood about looking in
      shop-windows until &lsquo;e see them coming along as hard as they could come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, halloa!&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Where did you spring from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&mdash;we&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been&mdash;for a bit of a walk,&rsquo; ses Ginger
      Dick, puffing and blowing like a grampus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To-keep down the &lsquo;unger,&rsquo; ses Peter Russet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Sam looked at &lsquo;em very stern for a moment, then he beckoned &lsquo;em to
      foller &lsquo;im, and, stopping at a little public-&rsquo;ouse, he went in and ordered
      a pint o&rsquo; bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And give them two pore fellers a crust o&rsquo; bread and cheese and
      &lsquo;arf-a-pint of four ale each,&rsquo; he ses to the barmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ginger and Peter looked at each other, but they was so hungry they didn&rsquo;t
      say a word; they just stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Put that inside you my pore fellers,&rsquo; ses Sam, with a oily smile. &lsquo;I
      can&rsquo;t bear to see people suffering for want o&rsquo; food,&rsquo; he ses to the
      barmaid, as he chucked down a sovereign on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The barmaid, a very nice gal with black &lsquo;air and her fingers covered all
      over with rings, said that it did &lsquo;im credit, and they stood there talking
      about tramps and beggars and such-like till Peter and Ginger nearly
      choked. He stood there watching &lsquo;em and smoking a threepenny cigar, and
      when they &lsquo;ad finished he told the barmaid to give &lsquo;em a sausage-roll
      each, and went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter and Ginger snatched up their sausage-rolls and follered &lsquo;im, and at
      last Ginger swallowed his pride and walked up to &lsquo;im and asked &lsquo;im to lend
      them some money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get it back agin,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;You know that well enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cert&rsquo;nly not,&rsquo; ses Sam; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m surprised at you asking. Why, a child
      could rob you. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;ard enough as it is for a pore man like me to &lsquo;ave to
      keep a couple o&rsquo; hulking sailormen, but I&rsquo;m not going to give you money to
      chuck away on lodgers. No more sleeping on the floor for me! Now I don&rsquo;t
      want none o&rsquo; your langwidge, and I don&rsquo;t want you follering me like a
      couple o&rsquo; cats arter a meat-barrer. I shall be &lsquo;aving a cup o&rsquo; tea at
      Brown&rsquo;s coffee-shop by and by, and if you&rsquo;re there at five sharp I&rsquo;ll see
      wot I can do for you. Wot did you call me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ginger told &lsquo;im three times, and then Peter Russet dragged &lsquo;im away. They
      turned up outside Brown&rsquo;s at a quarter to five, and at ten past six Sam
      Small strolled up smoking a cigar, and, arter telling them that he &lsquo;ad
      forgot all about &lsquo;em, took &lsquo;em inside and paid for their teas. He told Mr.
      Brown &lsquo;e was paying for &lsquo;em, and &lsquo;e told the gal wot served &lsquo;em &lsquo;e was
      paying for &lsquo;em, and it was all pore Ginger could do to stop &lsquo;imself from
      throwing his plate in &lsquo;is face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam went off by &lsquo;imself, and arter walking about all the evening without
      a ha&rsquo;penny in their pockets, Ginger Dick and Peter went off &lsquo;ome to bed
      and went to sleep till twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Sam came in and woke &lsquo;em up to
      tell &lsquo;em about a music-&rsquo;all he &lsquo;ad been to, and &lsquo;ow many pints he had &lsquo;ad.
      He sat up in bed till past one o&rsquo;clock talking about &lsquo;imself, and twice
      Peter Russet woke Ginger up to listen and got punched for &lsquo;is trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both said they&rsquo;d get a ship next morning, and then old Sam turned
      round and wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ear of it. The airs he gave &lsquo;imself was awful. He said
      he&rsquo;d tell &lsquo;em when they was to get a ship, and if they went and did things
      without asking &lsquo;im he&rsquo;d let &lsquo;em starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kept &lsquo;em with &lsquo;im all that day for fear of losing &lsquo;em and having to
      give &lsquo;em their money when &lsquo;e met &lsquo;em agin instead of spending it on &lsquo;em
      and getting praised for it. They &lsquo;ad their dinner with &lsquo;im at Brown&rsquo;s, and
      nothing they could do pleased him. He spoke to Peter Russet out loud about
      making a noise while he was eating, and directly arterwards he told Ginger
      to use his pocket &lsquo;ankercher. Pore Ginger sat there looking at &lsquo;im and
      swelling and swelling until he nearly bust, and Sam told &lsquo;im if he
      couldn&rsquo;t keep &lsquo;is temper when people was trying to do &lsquo;im a kindness he&rsquo;d
      better go and get somebody else to keep him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took &lsquo;em to a music-&rsquo;all that night, but he spoilt it all for &lsquo;em by
      taking &lsquo;em into the little public-&rsquo;ouse in Whitechapel Road fust and
      standing &lsquo;em a drink. He told the barmaid &lsquo;e was keeping &lsquo;em till they
      could find a job, and arter she &lsquo;ad told him he was too soft-&rsquo;arted and
      would only be took advantage of, she brought another barmaid up to look at
      &lsquo;em and ask &lsquo;em wot they could do, and why they didn&rsquo;t do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam served &lsquo;em like that for over a week, and he &lsquo;ad so much praise from
      Mr. Brown and other people that it nearly turned his &lsquo;ead. For once in his
      life he &lsquo;ad it pretty near all &lsquo;is own way. Twice Ginger Dick slipped off
      and tried to get a ship and came back sulky and hungry, and once Peter
      Russet sprained his thumb trying to get a job at the docks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave it up then and kept to Sam like a couple o&rsquo; shadders, only
      giving &lsquo;im back-answers when they felt as if something &lsquo;ud give way inside
      if they didn&rsquo;t. For the fust time in their lives they began to count the
      days till their boat was ready for sea. Then something happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They was all coming &lsquo;ome late one night along the Minories, when Ginger
      Dick gave a shout and, suddenly bolting up a little street arter a man
      that &lsquo;ad turned up there, fust of all sent &lsquo;im flying with a heavy punch
      of &lsquo;is fist, and then knelt on &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now then Ginger,&rsquo; ses Sam bustling up with Peter Russet, &lsquo;wot&rsquo;s all
      this? Wot yer doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the thief,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s our lodger. You keep still!&rsquo; he ses
      shaking the man. &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter gave a shout of joy, and stood by to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; ses old Sam, turning pale. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been drinking, Ginger.
      This comes of standing you &lsquo;arf-pints.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s him right enough,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d know &lsquo;is ugly face anywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You come off &lsquo;ome at once,&rsquo; ses Sam, very sharp, but his voice
      trembling. &lsquo;At once. D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fetch a policeman, Peter,&rsquo; ses Ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let the pore feller go, I tell you,&rsquo; ses Sam, stamping his foot. &lsquo;&rsquo;Ow
      would you like to be locked up? &lsquo;Ow would you like to be torn away from
      your wife and little ones? &lsquo;Ow would you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fetch a policeman, Peter,&rsquo; ses Ginger agin. &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, guv&rsquo;nor,&rsquo; ses the lodger. &lsquo;You got your money back. Wot&rsquo;s
      the good o&rsquo; putting me away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Got our wot back?&rsquo; ses Ginger, shaking &lsquo;im agin. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you try and be
      funny with me, else I&rsquo;ll tear you into little pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But he took it back,&rsquo; ses the man, trying to sit up and pointing at Sam.
      &lsquo;He follered me downstairs and took it all away from me. Your ticker as
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot?&rsquo; ses Ginger and Peter both together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strue as I&rsquo;m &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; ses the lodger. &lsquo;You turn &lsquo;is pockets out and see.
      Look out! He&rsquo;s going off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ginger turned his &lsquo;ead just in time to see old Sam nipping round the
      corner. He pulled the lodger up like a flash, and, telling Peter to take
      hold of the other side of him, they set off arter Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Little-joke-o&rsquo; mine-Ginger,&rsquo; ses Sam, when they caught &lsquo;im. &lsquo;I was going
      to tell you about it to-night. It ain&rsquo;t often I get the chance of a joke
      agin you Ginger; you&rsquo;re too sharp for a old man like me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ginger Dick didn&rsquo;t say anything. He kept &lsquo;old o&rsquo; Sam&rsquo;s arm with one hand
      and the lodger&rsquo;s neck with the other, and marched &lsquo;em off to his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shut the door when &lsquo;e got in, and arter Peter &lsquo;ad lit the candle they
      took hold o&rsquo; Sam and went through &lsquo;im, and arter trying to find pockets
      where he &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t got any, they took off &lsquo;is belt and found Ginger&rsquo;s watch,
      seventeen pounds five shillings, and a few coppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We &lsquo;ad over nine quid each, me and Peter,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the
      rest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got left,&rsquo; ses Sam; &lsquo;every ha&rsquo;penny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;ad to undress and even take &lsquo;is boots off afore they&rsquo;d believe &lsquo;im,
      and then Ginger took &lsquo;is watch and he ses to Peter, &lsquo;Lemme see; &lsquo;arf of
      seventeen pounds is eight pounds ten; &lsquo;arf of five shillings is
      &lsquo;arf-a-crown; and &lsquo;arf of fourpence is twopence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What about me Ginger old pal?&rsquo; ses Sam, in a kind voice. &lsquo;We must divide
      it into threes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Threes?&rsquo; ses Ginger, staring at&rsquo;im. &lsquo;Whaffor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Cos part of it&rsquo;s mine,&rsquo; ses Sam, struggling &lsquo;ard to be perlite. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      paid for everything for the last ten days, ain&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Ginger. &lsquo;You &lsquo;ave, and I thank you for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; ses Peter Russet. &lsquo;Hearty I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was your kind-&rsquo;artedness,&rsquo; ses Ginger, grinning like mad. &lsquo;You gave
      it to us, and we wouldn&rsquo;t dream of giving it to you back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind,&rsquo; ses Sam, choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes you did,&rsquo; ses Ginger, &lsquo;and you didn&rsquo;t forget to tell people
      neither. You told everybody. Now it&rsquo;s our turn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He opened the door and kicked the lodger out. Leastways, he would &lsquo;ave
      kicked &lsquo;im, but the chap was too quick for &lsquo;im. And then &lsquo;e came back,
      and, putting his arm round Peter&rsquo;s waist, danced a waltz round the room
      with &lsquo;im, while pore old Sam got on to his bed to be out of the way. They
      danced for nearly &lsquo;arf-an-hour, and then they undressed and sat on Peter&rsquo;s
      bed and talked. They talked in whispers at fust, but at last Sam &lsquo;eard
      Peter say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Threepence for &lsquo;is brekfuss; sevenpence for &lsquo;is dinner; threepence for
      &lsquo;is tea; penny for beer and a penny for bacca. &lsquo;Ow much is that, Ginger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;One bob,&rsquo; ses Ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter counted up to &lsquo;imself. &lsquo;I make it more than that, old pal,&rsquo; he ses,
      when he &lsquo;ad finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you?&rsquo; ses Ginger, getting up. &lsquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t; not if he counts it
      twenty times over he won&rsquo;t. Good-night, Peter. &lsquo;Appy dreams.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      Mr. Culpepper nodded. &ldquo;The worst of it is, girls don&rsquo;t like steady young
      men,&rdquo; he said, rumpling his thin grey hair; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the silly part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you was always steady, and Mrs. Culpepper married you,&rdquo; said the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper nodded again. &ldquo;She thought I was, and that came to the same
      thing,&rdquo; he said, composedly. &ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t for me to say, but she had an
      idea that I was very good-looking in them days. I had chestnutty hair. She
      burnt a piece of it only the other day she&rsquo;d kept for thirty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burnt it? What for?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words,&rdquo; said the other, lowering his voice. &ldquo;When I want one thing
      nowadays she generally wants another; and the things she wants ain&rsquo;t the
      things I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp shook his head and sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t talkative enough for Florrie, you know,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper,
      regarding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can talk all right as a rule,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Sharp. &ldquo;You ought to hear
      me at the debating society; but you can&rsquo;t talk to a girl who doesn&rsquo;t talk
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re far too humble,&rdquo; continued the other. &ldquo;You should cheek her a bit
      now and then. Let &lsquo;er see you&rsquo;ve got some spirit. Chaff &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; said the young man, restlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried it. Only the
      other day I called her &lsquo;a saucy little kipper,&rsquo; and the way she went on,
      anybody would have thought I&rsquo;d insulted her. Can&rsquo;t see a joke, I s&rsquo;pose.
      Where is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp. &ldquo;If it had been Jack Butler
      she&rsquo;d have been down fast enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be him,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, &ldquo;because I won&rsquo;t have &lsquo;im in the
      house. I&rsquo;ve told him so; I&rsquo;ve told her so, and I&rsquo;ve told &lsquo;er aunt so. And
      if she marries without my leave afore she&rsquo;s thirty she loses the seven
      hundred pounds &lsquo;er father left her. You&rsquo;ve got plenty of time&mdash;ten
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, sitting with his hands between his knees, gazed despondently at
      the floor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; girls would jump at me,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      only got to hold up my little finger and they&rsquo;d jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve got sense,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the
      sense to prefer steadiness and humdrumness to good looks and dash. A young
      fellow like you earning thirty-two-and-six a week can do without good
      looks, and if I&rsquo;ve told Florrie so once I have told her fifty times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks are a matter of taste,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, morosely. &ldquo;Some of them
      girls I was speaking about just now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, hastily. &ldquo;Now, look here; you go on a
      different tack. Take a glass of ale like a man or a couple o&rsquo; glasses;
      smoke a cigarette or a pipe. Be like other young men. Cut a dash, and
      don&rsquo;t be a namby-pamby. After you&rsquo;re married you can be as miserable as
      you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, after a somewhat lengthy interval, thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday next Wednesday,&rdquo; continued Mr. Culpepper, regarding him
      benevolently; &ldquo;come round about seven, and I&rsquo;ll ask you to stay to supper.
      That&rsquo;ll give you a chance. Anybody&rsquo;s allowed to step a bit over the mark
      on birthdays, and you might take a glass or two and make a speech, and be
      so happy and bright that they&rsquo;d &lsquo;ardly know you. If you want an excuse for
      calling, you could bring me a box of cigars for my birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or come in to wish you &lsquo;Many Happy Returns of the Day,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the thrifty
      Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget to get above yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, regarding
      him sternly; &ldquo;in a gentlemanly way, of course. Have as many glasses as you
      like&mdash;there&rsquo;s no stint about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it ever comes off,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, rising&mdash;&ldquo;if I get her through
      you, you shan&rsquo;t have reason to repent it. I&rsquo;ll look after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper, whose feelings were a trifle ruffled, said that he would
      &ldquo;look after it too.&rdquo; He had a faint idea that, even from his own point of
      view, he might have made a better selection for his niece&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp smoked his first cigarette the following morning, and,
      encouraged by the entire absence of any after-effects, purchased a pipe,
      which was taken up by a policeman the same evening for obstructing the
      public footpath in company with a metal tobacco-box three parts full.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of ale he found less difficulty. Certainly the taste was
      unpleasant, but, treated as medicine and gulped down quickly, it was
      endurable. After a day or two he even began to be critical, and on Monday
      evening went so far as to complain of its flatness to the wide-eyed
      landlord of the &ldquo;Royal George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much cellar-work,&rdquo; he said, as he finished his glass and made for the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much! &lsquo;Ere, come &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the landlord, thickly. &ldquo;I want to speak
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expert shook his head, and, passing out into, the street, changed
      colour as he saw Miss Garland approaching. In a blundering fashion he
      clutched at his hat and stammered out a &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Garland returned the greeting and, instead of passing on, stopped
      and, with a friendly smile, held out her hand. Mr. Sharp shook it
      convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the man I want to see,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Aunt and I have been
      talking about you all the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp said &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want uncle to see us,&rdquo; pursued Miss Garland, in the low tones
      of confidence. &ldquo;Which way shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s brain reeled. All ways were alike to him in such company. He
      walked beside her like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to give him a lesson,&rdquo; said the girl, presently. &ldquo;A lesson that
      he will remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; explained the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shocking thing, a wicked thing, to
      try and upset a steady young man like you. Aunt is quite put out about it,
      and I feel the same as she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; gasped the astonished Mr. Sharp, &ldquo;how did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt heard him,&rdquo; said Miss Garland. &ldquo;She was just going into the room
      when she caught a word or two, and she stayed outside and listened. You
      don&rsquo;t know what a lot she thinks of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s eyes opened wider than ever. &ldquo;I thought she didn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo;
       he said, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Miss Garland. &ldquo;Whatever could have put such an idea
      as that into your head? Of course, aunt isn&rsquo;t always going to let uncle
      see that she agrees with him. Still, as if anybody could help&mdash;&rdquo; she
      murmured to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said the young man, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Garland walked along with averted face; Mr. Sharp, his pulses
      bounding, trod on air beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, at last &ldquo;I thought that Jack Butler was a favourite
      of hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Butler!&rdquo; said the girl, in tones of scornful surprise. &ldquo;The idea!
      How blind men are; you&rsquo;re all alike, I think. You can&rsquo;t see two inches in
      front of you. She&rsquo;s as pleased as possible that you are coming on
      Wednesday; and so am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp caught his breath. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down here,&rdquo; said Miss Garland quickly; &ldquo;down by the river. And
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what we want you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand lightly on his arm, and Mr. Sharp, with a tremulous
      smile, obeyed. The smile faded gradually as he listened, and an expression
      of anxious astonishment took its place. He shook his head as she
      proceeded, and twice ventured a faint suggestion that she was only
      speaking in jest. Convinced at last, against his will, he walked on in
      silent consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said at last, as Miss Garland paused for breath, &ldquo;your uncle
      would never forgive me. He&rsquo;d never let me come near the house again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt will see to that,&rdquo; said the girl, confidently. &ldquo;But, of course, if
      you don&rsquo;t wish to please me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, and Mr. Sharp, plucking up spirit, ventured to take her
      hand and squeeze it. A faint, a very faint, squeeze in return decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link021" id="link021"></a> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="021.jpg (100K)" src="images/021.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will come all right afterwards,&rdquo; said Miss Garland, &ldquo;especially with
      the hold it will give aunt over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;If not, I shall be far&mdash;farther off
      than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Garland blushed and, turning her head, gazed steadily at the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Me and auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp said that so long as he pleased her nothing else mattered, and,
      in the seventh heaven of delight, paced slowly along the towpath by her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t mind what auntie and I say to you,&rdquo; said the girl,
      continuing her instructions. &ldquo;We must keep up appearances, you know; and
      if we seem to be angry, you must remember we are only pretending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, with a tender smile, said that he understood perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I had better go,&rdquo; said Florrie, returning the smile. &ldquo;Uncle might
      see us together, or somebody else might see us and tell him. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands and went off, stopping three times to turn and wave her
      hand. In a state of bewildered delight Mr. Sharp continued his stroll,
      rehearsing, as he went, the somewhat complicated and voluminous
      instructions she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Wednesday evening he was part-perfect, and, in a state of mind divided
      between nervousness and exaltation, set out for Mr. Culpepper&rsquo;s. He found
      that gentleman, dressed in his best, sitting in an easy-chair with his
      hands folded over a fancy waistcoat of startling design, and, placing a
      small box of small cigars on his knees, wished him the usual &ldquo;Happy
      Returns.&rdquo; The entrance of the ladies, who seemed as though they had just
      come off the ice, interrupted Mr. Culpepper&rsquo;s thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting spoiled, that&rsquo;s what I am,&rdquo; he remarked, playfully. &ldquo;See this
      waistcoat? My old Aunt Elizabeth sent it this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair and glanced down in warm approval. &ldquo;The missis
      gave me a pipe, and Florrie gave me half a pound of tobacco. And I bought
      a bottle of port wine myself, for all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a bottle that stood on the supper-table, and, the ladies
      retiring to the kitchen to bring in the supper, rose and placed chairs. A
      piece of roast beef was placed before him, and, motioning Mr. Sharp to a
      seat opposite Florrie, he began to carve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a nice comfortable party,&rdquo; he said, genially, as he finished. &ldquo;Help
      yourself to the ale, Bert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, ignoring the surprise on the faces of the ladies, complied, and
      passed the bottle to Mr. Culpepper. They drank to each other, and again a
      flicker of surprise appeared on the faces of Mrs. Culpepper and her niece.
      Mr. Culpepper, noticing it, shook his head waggishly at Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He drinks it as if he likes it,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Sharp, and, raising his glass, emptied it, and
      resumed the attack on his plate. Mr. Culpepper unscrewed the top of
      another bottle, and the reckless Mr. Sharp, after helping himself, made a
      short and feeling speech, in which he wished Mr. Culpepper long life and
      happiness. &ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t happy with Mrs. Culpepper,&rdquo; he concluded,
      gallantly, &ldquo;you ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper nodded and went on eating in silence until, the keen edge of
      his appetite having been taken off, he put down his knife and fork and
      waxed sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been married over thirty years,&rdquo; he said, slowly, with a glance at his
      wife, &ldquo;and never regretted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, me,&rdquo; returned the surprised Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, who had just raised his glass, put it down again and smiled. It
      was a faint smile, but it seemed to affect his host unfavourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you smiling at?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, exchanging a covert glance with Florrie.
      &ldquo;Something you told me the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper looked bewildered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a penny for them
      thoughts,&rdquo; he said, with an air of jocosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp shook his head. &ldquo;Money couldn&rsquo;t buy &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he said, with owlish
      solemnity, &ldquo;espec&mdash;especially after the good supper you&rsquo;re giving
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bert,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, uneasily, as his wife sat somewhat erect
      &ldquo;Bert, it&rsquo;s my birthday, and I don&rsquo;t grudge nothing to nobody; but go easy
      with the beer. You ain&rsquo;t used to it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the beer?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sharp. &ldquo;It tastes all
      right&mdash;what there is of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the beer; it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; explained Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp stared at him. &ldquo;Have I said anything I oughtn&rsquo;t to?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper shook his head, and, taking up a fork and spoon, began to
      serve a plum-pudding that Miss Garland had just placed on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you said I was to be sure and not tell Mrs. Culpepper?&rdquo;
       inquired Mr. Sharp, dreamily. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that, have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; snapped the harassed Mr. Culpepper, laying down the fork and spoon
      and regarding him ferociously. &ldquo;I mean, there wasn&rsquo;t anything. I mean, I
      didn&rsquo;t say so. You&rsquo;re raving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did say it, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; persisted Mr. Sharp. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say fairer
      than that, can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, trying, but in vain, to exchange a
      waggish glance with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, still smiling in a wooden fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the other thing?&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, in a thrilling whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; exclaimed the overwrought Mr. Culpepper; &ldquo;why not eat your
      pudding, and leave off talking nonsense? Nobody&rsquo;s listening to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; said his wife, tartly. &ldquo;I like to hear Mr. Sharp
      talk. What was it he told you not to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp eyed her mistily. &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he said, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Culpepper, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&mdash;it would make your hair stand on end,&rdquo; said the
      industrious Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Culpepper, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it would,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, indicating his host with his spoon,
      &ldquo;and he ought&mdash;to know&mdash; Who&rsquo;s that kicking me under the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper, shivering with wrath and dread, struggled for speech.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get home, Bert,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not yourself.
      There&rsquo;s nobody kicking you under the table. You don&rsquo;t know what you are
      saying. You&rsquo;ve been dreaming things. I never said anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Memory&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, shaking his head at him. &ldquo;Clean gone.
      Don&rsquo;t you remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; roared Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp sat blinking at him, but his misgivings vanished before the
      glances of admiring devotion which Miss Garland was sending in his
      direction. He construed them rightly not only as a reward, but as an
      incentive to further efforts. In the midst of an impressive silence Mrs.
      Culpepper collected the plates and, producing a dish of fruit from the
      sideboard, placed it upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yourself, Mr. Sharp,&rdquo; she said, pushing the bottle of port towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp complied, having first, after several refusals, put a little
      into the ladies&rsquo; glasses, and a lot on the tablecloth near Mr. Culpepper.
      Then, after a satisfying sip or two, he rose with a bland smile and
      announced his intention of making a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve made one,&rdquo; said his host, in tones of fierce expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;that was las&rsquo; night,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp. &ldquo;This is to-night&mdash;your
      birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t want any more,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only his fun,&rdquo; he said, looking round and
      raising his glass. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;m going to praise him up&mdash;praise
      him up. Here&rsquo;s to my old friend, Mr. Culpepper: one of the best. We all
      have our&mdash;faults, and he has his&mdash;has his. Where was I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; growled Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about my husband&rsquo;s faults,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, putting his hand to his brow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      alarm&rsquo;,&rdquo; he continued, turning to his host; &ldquo;nothing to be alarm&rsquo; about.
      I&rsquo;m not going to talk about &lsquo;em. Not so silly as that, I hope. I don&rsquo;t
      want spoil your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Culpepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very anxious he should sit down,&rdquo; said his wife, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper; &ldquo;only he&rsquo;s talking nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp, still on his legs, took another sip of port and, avoiding the
      eye of Mr. Culpepper, which was showing signs of incipient inflammation,
      looked for encouragement to Miss Garland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man we all look up to and respect,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;If he does go
      off to London every now and then on business, that&rsquo;s his lookout. My idea
      is he always ought to take Mrs. Culpepper with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have pleasure of her company and, same time, he&rsquo;d be money in pocket
      by it. And why shouldn&rsquo;t she go to music-halls sometimes? Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get off home,&rdquo; said the purple Mr. Culpepper, rising and hammering
      the table with his fist. &ldquo;Get off home; and if you so much as show your
      face inside this &lsquo;ouse again there&rsquo;ll be trouble. Go on. Out you go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Sharp, sitting down suddenly. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go home till
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll soon see about that,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, taking him by the
      shoulders. &ldquo;Come on, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp subsided lumpishly into his chair, and Mr. Culpepper, despite
      his utmost efforts, failed to move him. The two ladies exchanged a glance,
      and then, with their heads in the air, sailed out of the room, the younger
      pausing at the door to bestow a mirthful glance upon Mr. Sharp ere she
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;out,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You trying to tickle me?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get off home,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing nothing but make
      mischief ever since you came in. What put such things into your silly head
      I don&rsquo;t know. I shall never hear the end of &lsquo;em as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly head?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Sharp, with an alarming change of manner. &ldquo;Say
      it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culpepper repeated it with gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp. He seized him suddenly and, pushing him
      backwards into his easychair, stood over him with such hideous contortions
      of visage that Mr. Culpepper was horrified. &ldquo;Now you sit there and keep
      quite still,&rdquo; he said, with smouldering ferocity. &ldquo;Where did you put
      carving-knife? Eh? Where&rsquo;s carving-knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Bert,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, clutching at his sleeve. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      was only joking. You&mdash;you ain&rsquo;t quite yourself, Bert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded the other, rolling his eyes, and clenching his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I mean you&rsquo;ve improved,&rdquo; said Mr. Culpepper, hurriedly.
      &ldquo;Wonderful, you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s countenance cleared a little. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a night of it,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, whatever you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and, putting the wine and a couple of glasses on the
      mantelpiece, took a chair by Mr. Culpepper and prepared to spend the
      evening. His instructions were too specific to be disregarded, and three
      times he placed his arm about the waist of the frenzied Mr. Culpepper and
      took him for a lumbering dance up and down the room. In the intervals
      between dances he regaled him with interminable extracts from speeches
      made at the debating society and recitations learned at school.
      Suggestions relating to bed, thrown out by Mr. Culpepper from time to
      time, were repelled with scorn. And twice, in deference to Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s
      desires, he had to join in the chorus of a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o&rsquo;clock passed, and the hands of the clock crawled round to eleven.
      The hour struck, and, as though in answer, the door opened and the
      agreeable face of Florrie Garland appeared. Behind her, to the intense
      surprise of both gentlemen, loomed the stalwart figure of Mr. Jack Butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he might be useful, uncle,&rdquo; said Miss Garland, coming into the
      room. &ldquo;Auntie wouldn&rsquo;t let me come down before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp rose in a dazed fashion and saw Mr. Culpepper grasp Mr. Butler
      by the hand. More dazed still, he felt the large and clumsy hand of Mr.
      Butler take him by the collar and propel him with some violence along the
      small passage, while another hand, which he dimly recognized as belonging
      to Mr. Culpepper, was inserted in the small of his back. Then the front
      door opened and he was thrust out into the night. The door closed, and a
      low feminine laugh sounded from a window above.

    </p>
    <p>
      The night-watchman, who had left his seat on the jetty to answer the
      gate-bell, came back with disgust written on a countenance only too well
      designed to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s been up &lsquo;ere once in the last week to, know whether the <i>Silvia</i>
      is up she&rsquo;s been four or five times,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s forty-seven if
      he&rsquo;s a day; &lsquo;is left leg is shorter than &lsquo;is right, and he talks with a
      stutter. When she&rsquo;s with &lsquo;im you&rsquo;d think as butter wouldn&rsquo;t melt in &lsquo;er
      mouth; but the way she talked to me just now you&rsquo;d think I was paid
      a-purpose to wait on her. I asked &lsquo;er at last wot she thought I was here
      for, and she said she didn&rsquo;t know, and nobody else neither. And afore she
      went off she told the potman from the &lsquo;Albion,&rsquo; wot was listening, that I
      was known all over Wapping as the Sleeping Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t the fust I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad words with, not by a lot. They&rsquo;re all the
      same; they all start in a nice, kind, soapy sort o&rsquo; way, and, as soon as
      they don&rsquo;t get wot they want, fly into a temper and ask me who, I think I
      am. I told one woman once not to be silly, and I shall never forget it as
      long as I live-never. For all I know, she&rsquo;s wearing a bit o&rsquo; my &lsquo;air in a
      locket to this day, and very likely boasting that I gave it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of her reminds me of another woman. There was a Cap&rsquo;n Pinner,
      used to trade between &lsquo;ere and Hull on a schooner named the Snipe. Nice
      little craft she was, and &lsquo;e was a very nice feller. Many and many&rsquo;s the
      pint we&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad together, turn and turn-about, and the on&rsquo;y time we ever
      &lsquo;ad a cross word was when somebody hid his clay pipe in my beer and &lsquo;e was
      foolish enough to think I&rsquo;d done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;ad a nice little cottage, &lsquo;e told me about, near Hull, and &lsquo;is wife&rsquo;s
      father, a man of pretty near seventy, lived with &lsquo;em. Well-off the old man
      was, and, as she was his only daughter, they looked to &lsquo;ave all his money
      when he&rsquo;d gorn. Their only fear was that &lsquo;e might marry agin, and, judging
      from wot &lsquo;e used to tell me about the old man, I thought it more than
      likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for my missis he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been married over and over agin,&rsquo; he
      ses one day. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s like a child playing with gunpowder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow would it be to let &lsquo;im burn hisself a bit?&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you was to see some o&rsquo; the gunpowder he wants to play with, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk like that,&rsquo; ses the cap&rsquo;n. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d know better. The on&rsquo;y
      thing is to keep &lsquo;em apart, and my pore missis is wore to a shadder
      a-doing of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just about a month arter that that he brought the old man up to
      London with &lsquo;im. They &lsquo;ad some stuff to put out at Smith&rsquo;s Wharf, t&rsquo;other
      side of the river, afore they came to us, and though they was on&rsquo;y there
      four or five days, it was long enough for that old man to get into
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skipper told me about it ten minutes arter they was made snug in the
      inner berth &lsquo;ere. He walked up and down like a man with a raging
      toothache, and arter follering &lsquo;im up and down the wharf till I was tired
      out, I discovered that &lsquo;is father-in-law &lsquo;ad got &lsquo;imself mixed up with a
      widder-woman ninety years old and weighing twenty stun. Arter he &lsquo;ad
      cooled down a bit, and I &lsquo;ad given &lsquo;im a few little pats on the shoulder,
      &lsquo;e made it forty-eight years old and fourteen stun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s getting ready to go and meet her now,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;and wot my
      missis&rsquo;ll say to me, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father-in-law came up on deck as &lsquo;e spoke, and began to brush &lsquo;imself
      all over with a clothesbrush. Nice-looking little man &lsquo;e was, with blue
      eyes, and a little white beard, cut to a point, and dressed up in a serge
      suit with brass buttons, and a white yachting cap. His real name was Mr.
      Finch, but the skipper called &lsquo;im Uncle Dick, and he took such a fancy to
      me that in five minutes I was calling &lsquo;im Uncle Dick too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Time I was moving,&rsquo; he ses, by and by. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got an app&rsquo;intment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! who with?&rsquo; ses the skipper, pretending not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Friend o&rsquo; mine, in the army,&rsquo; ses the old man, with a wink at me. &lsquo;So
      long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went off as spry as a boy, and as soon as he&rsquo;d gorn the skipper
      started walking back&rsquo;ards and for&rsquo;ards agin, and raving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope as he&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y amusing &lsquo;imself,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wait till you see &lsquo;er,&rsquo; ses the skipper; &lsquo;then you won&rsquo;t talk
      foolishness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it &lsquo;appened she came back with Uncle Dick that evening, to see &lsquo;im
      safe, and I see at once wot sort of a woman it was. She &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t been on the
      wharf five minutes afore you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought it belonged to &lsquo;er, and when
      she went and sat on the schooner it seemed to be about &lsquo;arf its size. She
      called the skipper Tom, and sat there as cool as you please holding Uncle
      Dick&rsquo;s &lsquo;and, and patting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the skipper round to the &lsquo;Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; arter she &lsquo;ad gorn, and I
      wouldn&rsquo;t let &lsquo;im say a word until he had &lsquo;ad two pints. He felt better
      then, and some o&rsquo; the words &lsquo;e used surprised me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; he ses at last. &lsquo;You see &lsquo;ow it is, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you get &lsquo;im away?&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Who is she, and wot&rsquo;s &lsquo;er name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Her name,&rsquo; ses the skipper, &lsquo;her name is Jane Maria Elizabeth Muffit,
      and she lives over at Rotherhithe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s very likely married already,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Her &lsquo;usband died ten years ago,&rsquo; ses the skipper; &lsquo;passed away in &lsquo;is
      sleep. Overlaid, I should say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sat there smoking, and I sat there thinking. Twice &lsquo;e spoke to me, and
      I held my &lsquo;and up and said &lsquo;H&rsquo;sh.&rsquo; Then I turned to &lsquo;im all of a sudden
      and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped &lsquo;is beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is Uncle Dick a nervous man?&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nervous is no name for it,&rsquo; he ses, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good, then,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send &lsquo;er husband to frighten &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skipper looked at me very strange. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Yes. Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Frighten &lsquo;im out of &lsquo;is boots, and make him give &lsquo;er up,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Or
      better still, get &lsquo;im to run away and go into hiding for a time. That &lsquo;ud
      be best, in case &lsquo;e found out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Found out wot?&rsquo; ses the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Found out it wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;er husband,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; ses the skipper, very earnest, &lsquo;this is the fust beer I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad
      to-day, and I wish I could say the same for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take &lsquo;im at fast, but when I did I gave a laugh that brought in
      two more customers to see wot was the matter. Then I took &lsquo;im by the arm&mdash;arter
      a little trouble&mdash;and, taking &lsquo;im back to the wharf, explained my
      meaning to &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know the very man,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;He comes into a public-&rsquo;ouse down my way
      sometimes. Artful &lsquo;Arry, he&rsquo;s called, and, for &lsquo;arf-a-quid, say, he&rsquo;d
      frighten Uncle Dick &lsquo;arf to death. He&rsquo;s big and ugly, and picks up a
      living by selling meerschaum pipes he&rsquo;s found to small men wot don&rsquo;t want
      &lsquo;em. Wonderful gift o&rsquo; the gab he&rsquo;s got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went acrost to the &lsquo;Albion&rsquo; to talk it over. There&rsquo;s several bars
      there, and the landlady always keeps cotton-wool in &lsquo;er ears, not &lsquo;aving
      been brought up to the public line. The skipper told me all &lsquo;e knew about
      Mrs. Muffit, and we arranged that Artful &lsquo;Arry should come down at seven
      o&rsquo;clock next night, if so be as I could find &lsquo;im in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up early the next arternoon, and as it &lsquo;appened, he came into the
      &lsquo;Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo; five minutes arter I got there. Nasty temper &lsquo;e was
      in, too. He&rsquo;d just found a meerschaum pipe, as usual, and the very fust
      man &lsquo;e tried to sell it to said that it was the one &lsquo;e lost last
      Christmas, and gave &lsquo;im a punch in the jaw for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a thief, that&rsquo;s wot he is,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry; &lsquo;and I &lsquo;ate thiefs. &lsquo;Ow&rsquo;s a
      honest tradesman to make a living when there&rsquo;s people like that about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood &lsquo;im &lsquo;arf a pint, and though it hurt &lsquo;im awful to drink it, he
      said &lsquo;ed &lsquo;ave another just to see if he could bear the pain. Arter he had
      &lsquo;ad three &lsquo;e began for to take a more cheerful view o&rsquo; life, and told me
      about a chap that spent three weeks in the London &lsquo;Orsepittle for calling
      &lsquo;im a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Treat me fair,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll treat other people fair. I never broke
      my word without a good reason for it, and that&rsquo;s more than everybody can
      say. If I told you the praise I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad from some people you wouldn&rsquo;t
      believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let &lsquo;im go on till he &lsquo;ad talked &lsquo;imself into a good temper, and then I
      told &lsquo;im of the little job I &lsquo;ad got for &lsquo;im. He listened quiet till I &lsquo;ad
      finished, and then he shook &lsquo;is &lsquo;ead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t in my line,&rsquo; he ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s &lsquo;arf a quid &lsquo;anging to it,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arry shook his &lsquo;ead agin. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t enough, mate,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;If you was to
      make it a quid I won&rsquo;t say as I mightn&rsquo;t think of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ad told the skipper that it might cost &lsquo;im a quid, so I knew &lsquo;ow far I
      could go; and at last, arter &lsquo;Arry &lsquo;ad got as far as the door three times,
      I gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave it now,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;to prevent mistakes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, &lsquo;Arry,&rsquo; I ses, very firm. &lsquo;Besides, it ain&rsquo;t my money, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You mean to say you don&rsquo;t trust me,&rsquo; &lsquo;e ses, firing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d trust you with untold gold,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;but not with a real quid;
      you&rsquo;re too fond of a joke, &lsquo;Arry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ad another long argyment about it, and I had to tell &lsquo;im plain at
      last that when I wanted to smell &lsquo;is fist, I&rsquo;d say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You turn up at the wharf at five minutes to seven,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      give you ten bob of it; arter you&rsquo;ve done your business I&rsquo;ll give you the
      other. Come along quiet, and you&rsquo;ll see me waiting at the gate for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave way arter a time, and, fust going &lsquo;ome for a cup o&rsquo; tea, I went
      on to the wharf to tell the skipper &lsquo;ow things stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave &lsquo;appened better,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Uncle Dick is sure to be
      aboard at that time, &lsquo;cos &lsquo;e&rsquo;s going acrost the water at eight o&rsquo;clock to
      pay &lsquo;er a visit. And all the hands&rsquo;ll be away. I&rsquo;ve made sure of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me the money for Artful &lsquo;Arry in two &lsquo;arf-suverins, and then we
      went over to the &lsquo;Albion&rsquo; for a quiet glass and a pipe, and to wait for
      seven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left &lsquo;im there at ten minutes to, and at five minutes to, punctual to
      the minute, I see &lsquo;Arry coming along swinging a thick stick with a knob on
      the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the &lsquo;arf thick-un?&rsquo; he ses, looking round to see that the coast
      was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave it to &lsquo;im, and arter biting it in three places and saying it was a
      bit short in weight he dropped it in &lsquo;is weskit-pocket and said &lsquo;e was
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left &lsquo;im there for a minute while I went and &lsquo;ad a look round. The deck
      of the Snipe was empty, but I could &lsquo;ear Uncle Dick down in the cabin
      singing; and, arter listening for a few seconds to make sure that it was
      singing, I went back and beckoned to &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s down in the cabin,&rsquo; I ses, pointing. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, &lsquo;Arry, and
      at the same time don&rsquo;t underdo it, as you might say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know just wot you want,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, &lsquo;and if you&rsquo;d got the &lsquo;art of a
      man in you, you&rsquo;d make it two quids.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He climbed on board and stood listening for a moment at the companion,
      and then &lsquo;e went down, while I went off outside the gate, so as to be out
      of earshot in case Uncle Dick called for me. I knew that I should &lsquo;ear all
      about wot went on arterwards&mdash;and I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artful &lsquo;Arry went down the companion-ladder very quiet, and then stood at
      the foot of it looking at Uncle Dick. He looked &lsquo;im up and down and all
      over, and then &lsquo;e gave a fierce, loud cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-evening,&rsquo; he ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-evening,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, staring at &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Did you want to see
      anybody?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;I do. And when I see &lsquo;im I&rsquo;m going to put my arms
      round &lsquo;im and twist &lsquo;is neck; then I&rsquo;m going to break every bone in &lsquo;is
      body, and arter that I&rsquo;m going to shy &lsquo;im overboard to pison the fishes
      with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, shifting away as far as &lsquo;e could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;ad a wink o&rsquo; sleep for two nights,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry&mdash;&lsquo;not ever
      since I &lsquo;eard of it. When I think of all I&rsquo;ve done for that woman-working
      for &lsquo;er, and such-like-my blood boils. When I think of her passing &lsquo;erself
      off as a widder&mdash;my widder&mdash;and going out with another man, I
      don&rsquo;t know wot to do with myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Dick started and turned pale. Fust &lsquo;e seemed as if &lsquo;e was going to
      speak, and then &lsquo;e thought better of it. He sat staring at &lsquo;Arry as if &lsquo;e
      couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot would you do with a man like that?&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;I ask you, as man to
      man, wot would you do to &lsquo;im?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps-p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps &lsquo;e didn&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t care, you mean. We&rsquo;ve got a nice little
      &lsquo;ome, and, just because I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad to leave it and lay low for a bit for
      knifing a man, she takes advantage of it. And it ain&rsquo;t the fust time,
      neither. Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Touch-touch of ague; I get it sometimes,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want to see this man Finch,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, shaking &lsquo;is knobby stick.
      &lsquo;Muffit, my name is, and I want to tell &lsquo;im so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Dick nearly shook &lsquo;imself on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go and see if &lsquo;e&rsquo;s in the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle,&rsquo; he ses at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t there, &lsquo;cos I&rsquo;ve looked,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, &lsquo;arf shutting &lsquo;is eyes and
      looking at &lsquo;im hard. &lsquo;Wot might your name be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Finch,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, putting out his &lsquo;ands to keep him off;
      &lsquo;but I thought she was a widder. She told me her &lsquo;usband died ten years
      ago; she&rsquo;s deceived me as well as you. I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; dreamt of taking any
      notice of &lsquo;er if I&rsquo;d known. Truth, I wouldn&rsquo;t. I should&rsquo;nt ha&rsquo; dreamt of
      such a thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artful &lsquo;Arry played with &lsquo;is stick a little, and stood looking at &lsquo;im
      with a horrible look on &lsquo;is face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow am I to know you&rsquo;re speaking the truth?&rsquo; he ses, very slow. &lsquo;Eh? &lsquo;Ow
      can you prove it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If it was the last word I was to speak I&rsquo;d say the same,&rsquo; ses Uncle
      Dick. &lsquo;I tell you, I am as innercent as a new-born babe.&rsquo;

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s deceived both of us. Now, if I let
      you go will you go straight off and bring her &lsquo;ere to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Arf a mo,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, holding up &lsquo;is stick very quick. &lsquo;One thing is,
      if you don&rsquo;t come back, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave you another day. I can&rsquo;t make up my mind
      wot to do. I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t tasted food for two days. If I &lsquo;ad
      any money in my pocket I&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave a bite while you&rsquo;re gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not get something?&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick, putting his &lsquo;and in his pocket,
      in a great &lsquo;urry to please him, and pulling out some silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arry said &lsquo;e would, and then he stood on one side to let &lsquo;im pass, and
      even put the knobby stick under &lsquo;im to help &lsquo;im up the companion-ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Dick passed me two minutes arterwards without a word, and set off
      down the road as fast as &lsquo;is little legs &lsquo;ud carry &lsquo;im. I watched &lsquo;im out
      o&rsquo; sight, and then I went on board the schooner to see how &lsquo;Arry &lsquo;ad got
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arry,&rsquo; I ses, when he &lsquo;ad finished, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a masterpiece!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know I am,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Wot about that other &lsquo;arf-quid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; I ses, giving it to &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Fair masterpiece, that&rsquo;s wot you
      are. They may well call you Artful. Shake &lsquo;ands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I patted &lsquo;im on the shoulder arter we &lsquo;ad shook &lsquo;ands, and we stood there
      smiling at each other and paying each other compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fancy &lsquo;em sitting &lsquo;ere and waiting for you to come back from that bite,&rsquo; 
      I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I ought to &lsquo;ave &lsquo;ad more off of him,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;&rsquo;Owever, it can&rsquo;t be
      helped. I think I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave a lay down for a bit; I&rsquo;m tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Better be off,&rsquo; I ses, shaking my &lsquo;ead. &lsquo;Time passes, and they might
      come back afore you think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, wot of it?&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot of it?&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;ud spoil everything. It &lsquo;ud be blue ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sartin,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, make it five quid, and I&rsquo;ll go, then,&rsquo; he ses, sitting down agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears at fust, but when I could I drew myself up and
      told &lsquo;im wot I thought of &lsquo;im; and he sat there and laughed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you called me a masterpiece just now,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be much
      of a masterpiece if I let a chance like this slip. Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t be
      able to look myself in the face. Where&rsquo;s the skipper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sitting in the &ldquo;Albion&rdquo;,&rsquo; I ses, &lsquo;arf choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go and tell &lsquo;im it&rsquo;s five quid,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean five more,
      on&rsquo;y four. Some people would ha&rsquo; made it five, but I like to deal square
      and honest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I run over for the skipper in a state of mind that don&rsquo;t bear thinking
      of, and he came back with me, &lsquo;arf crazy. When we got to the cabin we
      found the door was locked, and, arter the skipper &lsquo;ad told Artful wot he&rsquo;d
      do to &lsquo;im if he didn&rsquo;t open it, he &lsquo;ad to go on deck and talk to &lsquo;im
      through the skylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you ain&rsquo;t off of my ship in two twos,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch a
      policeman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You go and fetch four pounds,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s wot I&rsquo;m waiting for,
      not a policeman. Didn&rsquo;t the watchman tell you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The bargain was for one pound,&rsquo; ses the skipper, &lsquo;ardly able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you tell that to the policeman,&rsquo; ses Artful &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no use, he&rsquo;d got us every way; and at last the skipper turns out
      &lsquo;is pockets, and he ses, &lsquo;Look &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got seventeen and
      tenpence ha&rsquo; penny. Will you go if I give you that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow much has the watchman got?&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;His lodger lost &lsquo;is purse
      the other day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d got two and ninepence, as it &lsquo;appened, and then there was more
      trouble because the skipper wouldn&rsquo;t give &lsquo;im the money till he &lsquo;ad gone,
      and &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t go till he &lsquo;ad got it. The skipper gave way at last, and
      as soon as he &lsquo;ad got it &lsquo;Arry ses, &lsquo;Now &lsquo;op off and borrer the rest, and
      look slippy about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put one hand over the skipper&rsquo;s mouth fust, and then, finding that was
      no good, I put the other. It was no good wasting bad langwidge on &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pacified the skipper at last, and arter &lsquo;Arry &lsquo;ad swore true &lsquo;e&rsquo;d go
      when &lsquo;e&rsquo;d got the money, the skipper rushed round to try and raise it.
      It&rsquo;s a difficult job at the best o&rsquo; times, and I sat there on the skylight
      shivering and wondering whether the skipper or Mrs. Muffit would turn up
      fust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hours seemed to pass away, and then I see the wicket in the gate open,
      and the skipper come through. He jumped on deck without a word, and then,
      going over to the skylight, &lsquo;anded down the money to &lsquo;Arry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Right-o,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry. &lsquo;It on&rsquo;y shows you wot you can do by trying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He unlocked the door and came up on deck, looking at us very careful, and
      playing with &lsquo;is stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got your money,&rsquo; ses the skipper; &lsquo;now go as quick as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arry smiled and nodded at him. Then he stepped on to the wharf and was
      just moving to the gate, with us follering, when the wicket opened and in
      came Mrs. Muffit and Uncle Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There he is,&rsquo; ses Uncle Dick. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Muffit walked up to &lsquo;im, and my &lsquo;art a&rsquo;most stopped beating. Her
      face was the colour of beetroot with temper, and you could &lsquo;ave heard her
      breath fifty yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ho!&rsquo; she says, planting &lsquo;erself in front of Artful &lsquo;Arry, &lsquo;so you&rsquo;re the
      man that ses you&rsquo;re my &lsquo;usband, are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all a mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MISTAKE?&rsquo; ses Mrs. Muffit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mistake o&rsquo; Bill&rsquo;s,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;Arry, pointing to me. &lsquo;I told &lsquo;im I thought &lsquo;e
      was wrong, but &lsquo;e would &lsquo;ave it. I&rsquo;ve got a bad memory, so I left it to
      &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ho!&rsquo; ses Mrs. Muffit, taking a deep breath. &lsquo;Ho! I thought as much. Wot
      &lsquo;ave you got to say for yourself&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She turned on me like a wild cat, with her &lsquo;ands in front of her. I&rsquo;ve
      been scratched once in my life, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to be agin, so, fixing
      my eyes on &lsquo;er, I just stepped back a bit, ready for &lsquo;er. So long as I
      kept my eye fixed on &lsquo;ers she couldn&rsquo;t do anything. I knew that.
      Unfortunately I stepped back just a inch too far, and next moment I went
      over back&rsquo;ards in twelve foot of water.

      Mr. George Wotton, gently pushing the swing doors of the public bar of the
      &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; an inch apart, applied an eye to the aperture, in the hope
      of discovering a moneyed friend. His gaze fell on the only man in the bar
      a greybeard of sixty whose weather-beaten face and rough clothing spoke of
      the sea. With a faint sigh he widened the opening and passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Ben,&rdquo; he said, with an attempt at cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a drop with me,&rdquo; said the other, heartily. &ldquo;Got any money about
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton shook his head and his face fell, clearing somewhat as the
      other handed him his mug. &ldquo;Drink it all up, George,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend complied. A more tactful man might have taken longer over the
      job, but Mr. Benjamin Davis, who appeared to be labouring under some
      strong excitement, took no notice.

      &ldquo;She left me,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;she left me thirty-five
      years ago. I went off to sea one fine morning, and that was the last I
      ever see of er.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did she bolt?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Wotton, with mild interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;but I did. We&rsquo;d been married three years&mdash;three
      long years&mdash;and I had &lsquo;ad enough of it. Awful temper she had. The
      last words I ever heard &lsquo;er say was: &lsquo;Take that!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton took up the mug and, after satisfying himself as to the absence
      of contents, put it down again and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it if I was you,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hardly
      likely to find you now. And if she does she won&rsquo;t get much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis gave vent to a contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;Get much!&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her what&rsquo;s got it. I met a old shipmate of mine this morning what I
      &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t seen for ten years, and he told me he run acrost &lsquo;er only a month
      ago. After she left me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you left her!&rdquo; exclaimed his listening friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, impatiently. &ldquo;After she left me to work
      myself to death at sea, running here and there at the orders of a pack
      o&rsquo;lazy scuts aft, she went into service and stayed in one place for
      fifteen years. Then &lsquo;er missis died and left her all &lsquo;er money. For twenty
      years, while I&rsquo;ve been working myself to skin and bone, she&rsquo;s been living
      in comfort and idleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ard lines,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, shaking his head. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t bear thinking
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she advertise for me?&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, raising his voice.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know. Advertisements is cheap enough; why didn&rsquo;t
      she advertise? I should &lsquo;ave come at once if she&rsquo;d said anything about
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton shook his head again. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she didn&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; he said,
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rdquo; demanded the other. &ldquo;It was &lsquo;er dooty.
      She&rsquo;d got money, and I ought to have &lsquo;ad my &lsquo;arf of it. Nothing can make
      up for that wasted twenty years&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she&rsquo;ll take you back,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me back?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Davis. &ldquo;O&rsquo; course she&rsquo;ll take me back. She&rsquo;ll
      have to. There&rsquo;s a law in the land, ain&rsquo;t there? What I&rsquo;m thinking of is:
      Can I get back my share what I ought to have &lsquo;ad for the last twenty
      years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get &lsquo;er to take you back first,&rdquo; counselled his friend. &ldquo;Thirty-five
      years is along time, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she has lost &lsquo;er love for you. Was you
      good-looking in those days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; snapped Mr. Davis; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t altered much&mdash;. &lsquo;Sides, what about
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t the question,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a home and money. It
      don&rsquo;t matter about looks; and, wot&rsquo;s more, she ain&rsquo;t bound to keep you. If
      you take my advice, you won&rsquo;t dream of letting her know you run away from
      her. Say you was cast away at sea, and when you came back years afterwards
      you couldn&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis pondered for some time in sulky silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it would be as well,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stand no
      nonsense, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to
      do. I could tell &lsquo;er I was cast away with you if you liked. Anything to
      help a pal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis took two inches of soiled clay pipe from his pocket and puffed
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d only got a copper or two we
      could ride; it&rsquo;s down Clapham way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton smiled feebly, and after going carefully through his pockets
      shook his head and followed his friend outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether she&rsquo;ll be pleased?&rdquo; he remarked, as they walked slowly
      along. &ldquo;She might be&mdash;women are funny creatures&mdash;so faithful. I
      knew one whose husband used to knock &lsquo;er about dreadful, and after he died
      she was so true to his memory she wouldn&rsquo;t marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis grunted, and, with a longing eye at the omnibuses passing over
      London Bridge, asked a policeman the distance to Clapham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, as his friend uttered an exclamation.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have money in your pocket soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;And a watch and chain too,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And smoke your cigar of a Sunday,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, &ldquo;and have a
      easy-chair and a glass for a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis almost smiled, and then, suddenly remembering his wasted twenty
      years, shook his head grimly over the friendship that attached itself to
      easy-chairs and glasses of ale, and said that there was plenty of it
      about. More friendship than glasses of ale and easy-chairs, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Clapham, they inquired the way of a small boy, and, after following the
      road indicated, retraced their steps, cheered by a faint but bloodthirsty
      hope of meeting him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friendly baker put them on the right track at last, both gentlemen
      eyeing the road with a mixture of concern and delight. It was a road of
      trim semi-detached villas, each with a well-kept front garden and
      neatly-curtained windows. At the gate of a house with the word
      &ldquo;Blairgowrie&rdquo; inscribed in huge gilt letters on the fanlight Mr. Davis
      paused for a moment uneasily, and then, walking up the path, followed by
      Mr. Wotton, knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired a step in disorder before the apparition of a maid in cap and
      apron. A sharp &ldquo;Not to-day!&rdquo; sounded in his ears and the door closed
      again. He faced his friend gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should give her the sack first thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis knocked again, and again. The maid reappeared, and after
      surveying them through the glass opened the door a little way and
      parleyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see your missis,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell &lsquo;er,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, inserting his foot just in time, &ldquo;you tell
      &lsquo;er that there&rsquo;s two gentlemen here what have brought &lsquo;er news of her
      husband, and look sharp about it.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They was cast away with &lsquo;im,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a desert island,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis. He pushed his way in, followed by
      his friend, and a head that had been leaning over the banisters was
      suddenly withdrawn. For a moment he stood irresolute in the tiny passage,
      and then, with a husband&rsquo;s boldness, he entered the front room and threw
      himself into an easy-chair. Mr. Wotton, after a scared glance around the
      well-furnished room, seated himself on the extreme edge of the most
      uncomfortable chair he could find and coughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not be too sudden with her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want her to
      faint, or anything of that sort. Don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;er know who you are at first;
      let her find it out for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis, who was also suffering from the stiff grandeur of his
      surroundings, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d better start, in case she reckernizes my voice,&rdquo; he said,
      slowly. &ldquo;Pitch it in strong about me and &lsquo;ow I was always wondering what
      had &lsquo;appened to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, that&rsquo;s wot you are,&rdquo; said his friend, enviously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      only seen furniture like thiss in shop windows before. H&rsquo;sh! Here she
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, and both men tried to look at their ease as a stiff rustling
      sounded from the stairs. Then the door opened and a tall, stoutly-built
      old lady with white hair swept into the room and stood regarding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis, unprepared for the changes wrought by thirty-five years, stared
      at her aghast. The black silk dress, the gold watch-chain, and huge cameo
      brooch did not help to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-good afternoon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, in a thin voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady returned the greeting, and, crossing to a chair and seating
      herself in a very upright fashion, regarded him calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;we called to see you about a dear old pal&mdash;friend, I mean,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Wotton; &ldquo;one o&rsquo; the best. The best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been missing,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, watching closely for any symptoms of
      fainting, &ldquo;for thir-ty-five years. Thir-ty-five years ago-very much
      against his wish-he left &lsquo;is young and handsome wife to go for a sea
      v&rsquo;y&rsquo;ge, and was shipwrecked and cast away on a desert island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the old lady again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was cast away with &lsquo;im,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton. &ldquo;Both of us was cast away
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He indicated Mr. Davis with his hand, and the old lady, after a glance at
      that gentleman, turned to Mr. Wotton again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was on that island for longer than I like to think of,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Wotton, who had a wholesome dread of dates. &ldquo;But we was rescued at last,
      and ever since then he has been hunting high and low for his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; murmured the old lady; &ldquo;but what has it got to do
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton gasped, and cast a helpless glance at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t heard his name yet,&rdquo; he said, impressively. &ldquo;Wot would you say
      if I said it was&mdash;Ben Davis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it wasn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; said the old lady, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;true?&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, catching his breath painfully. &ldquo;Wish I
      may die&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the desert island,&rdquo; continued the old lady, calmly. &ldquo;The story that
      I heard was that he went off like a cur and left his young wife to do the
      best she could for herself. I suppose he&rsquo;s heard since that she has come
      in for a bit of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wotton, in a voice that he fondly hoped expressed
      artless surprise. &ldquo;Money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;and I suppose he sent you two gentlemen round
      to see how the land lay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking full at Mr. Davis as she spoke, and both men began to take
      a somewhat sombre view of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know him, else you wouldn&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d know &lsquo;im if you was to see him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I should,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d reckernize his voice?&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, breaking silence at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton held his breath, but the old lady merely shook her head
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;It was a disagreeable voice when his wife used to hear it,&rdquo;
       she said at last. &ldquo;Always fault-finding, when it wasn&rsquo;t swearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton glanced at his friend, and, raising his eyebrows slightly, gave
      up his task. &ldquo;Might ha&rsquo; been faults on both sides,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis,
      gruffly. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t all that you should ha&rsquo; been, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said his hostess, raising her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, rising. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Mary? Why, I knew
      you the moment you come into the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link027" id="link027"></a> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="027.jpg (84K)" src="images/027.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards her awkwardly, but she rose in her turn and drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you touch me I&rsquo;ll scream,&rdquo; she said, firmly. &ldquo;How dare you. Why, I&rsquo;ve
      never seen you before in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ben Davis, ma&rsquo;am; it&rsquo;s &lsquo;im, right enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; commanded Mr. Davis, sternly. &ldquo;Look at me straight in the
      eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said the other, sharply. &ldquo;Look you in the eye,
      indeed! I don&rsquo;t want to look in your eye. What would people think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em think wot they like,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, recklessly. &ldquo;This is a nice
      home-coming after being away thirty-five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of it on a desert island,&rdquo; put in Mr. Wotton, pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Davis; &ldquo;come back to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hung his cap on a vase on the mantelpiece that reeled under the shock,
      and, dropping into his chair again, crossed his legs and eyed her sternly.
      Her gaze was riveted on his dilapidated boots. She looked up and spoke
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mistake&mdash;I think
      you had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, with a hard laugh. &ldquo;Indeed! And &lsquo;ow do you know I&rsquo;m
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the best of reasons,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Besides, how can you prove that
      you are? Thirty-five years is a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Specially on a desert island,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotton, rapidly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be
      surprised &lsquo;ow slow the time passes. I was there with &lsquo;im, and I can lay my
      hand on my &lsquo;art and assure you that that is your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the old lady, vigorously. &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prove it,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, fixing her with a glittering eye. &ldquo;Do
      you remember the serpent I &lsquo;ad tattooed on my leg for a garter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go at once,&rdquo; said the old lady, hastily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for the
      police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to admire it,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, reproachfully. &ldquo;I remember once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say another word,&rdquo; said the other, in a fierce voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send
      straight off for the police. You and your serpents! I&rsquo;ll tell my husband
      of you, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your WHAT?&rdquo; roared Mr. Davis, springing to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband. He won&rsquo;t stand any of your nonsense, I can tell you. You&rsquo;d
      better go before he comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, taking a long breath. &ldquo;Oh, so you been and got
      married again, &lsquo;ave you? That&rsquo;s your love for your husband as was cast
      away while trying to earn a living for you. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t want me,
      is it? We&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; said the other, with great
      dignity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been married once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis passed the back of his hand across his eyes in a dazed fashion
      and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is somebody passing himself off as me?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cos if he
      is I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave you both up for bigamy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis turned and looked blankly at his friend. Mr. Wotton met his gaze
      with dilated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you recognize me as your wife?&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very curious,&rdquo; said the other&mdash;&ldquo;very. But are you sure? Look
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis thrust his face close to hers and stared hard. She bore his
      scrutiny without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive certain,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, taking a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very curious,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;but, then, I suppose we are a
      bit alike. You see, Mrs. Davis being away, I&rsquo;m looking after her house for
      a bit. My name happens to be Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis uttered a sharp exclamation, and, falling back a step, stared at
      her open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all make mistakes,&rdquo; urged Mr. Wotton, after a long silence, &ldquo;and Ben&rsquo;s
      sight ain&rsquo;t wot it used to be. He strained it looking out for a sail when
      we was on that desert&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;when&rsquo;ll she be back?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Davis, finding his voice at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady affected to look puzzled. &ldquo;But I thought you were certain
      that I was your wife?&rdquo; she said, smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, ruefully. &ldquo;Thirty-five years is a long time
      and people change a bit; I have myself. For one thing, I must say I didn&rsquo;t
      expect to find &lsquo;er so stout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stout!&rdquo; repeated the other, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I mean you&rsquo;re too stout,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;for
      people that like stoutness, that is. My wife used to &lsquo;ave a very good
      figger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wotton nodded. &ldquo;He used to rave about it on that des&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will she be back?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Davis, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Smith shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she replied, moving towards the
      door. &ldquo;When she&rsquo;s off holidaying, I never know when she&rsquo;ll return. Shall I
      tell her you called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I&mdash;&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, with great vehemence.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in a week&rsquo;s time and see if she&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might be away for months,&rdquo; said the old lady, moving slowly to the
      passage and opening the street door. &ldquo;Good-afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door behind them and stood watching them through the glass
      as they passed disconsolately into the street. Then she went back into the
      parlour, and standing before the mantelpiece, looked long and earnestly
      into the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis returned a week later&mdash;alone, and, pausing at the gate,
      glanced in dismay at a bill in the window announcing that the house was to
      be sold. He walked up the path still looking at it, and being admitted by
      the trim servant was shown into the parlour, and stood in a dispirited
      fashion before Mrs. Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not back yet?&rdquo; he inquired, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;is that bill for?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Davis, jerking his
      thumb towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is thinking of selling the house,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;I let her know
      you had been, and that is, the result. She won&rsquo;t comeback. You won&rsquo;t see
      her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Davis, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Smith shook her head again. &ldquo;And it would be no use my telling you,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;What she has got is her own, and the law won&rsquo;t let you touch a
      penny of it without her consent. You must have treated her badly; why did
      you leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Davis. &ldquo;Why? Why, because she hit me over the &lsquo;ead
      with a broom-handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Smith tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy you remembering that for thirty-five years!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy forgetting it!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she had a hot temper,&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ot temper?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He leaned forward, and holding his
      chilled hands over the fire stood for some time deep in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a something about
      you that reminds me of her. It ain&rsquo;t your voice, &lsquo;cos she had a very nice
      voice&mdash;when she wasn&rsquo;t in a temper&mdash;and it ain&rsquo;t your face,
      because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, sharply. &ldquo;Because it don&rsquo;t remind me of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet the other day you said you recognized me at once,&rdquo; said the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I did,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis. &ldquo;One thing is, I was expecting to see
      her, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t keep you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith at last, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s no good for
      you to keep coming here to see her. She will never come here again. I
      don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings, but you don&rsquo;t look over and above
      respectable. Your coat is torn, your trousers are patched in a dozen
      places, and your boots are half off your feet&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what the
      servant must think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I only came to look for my wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, in a startled
      voice. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll please her, I know. And if she
      should happen to ask what sort of a living you are making, what shall I
      tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her what you said about my clothes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, with his
      hand on the door-knob. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll understand then. She&rsquo;s known wot it is to
      be poor herself. She&rsquo;d got a bad temper, but she&rsquo;d have cut her tongue out
      afore she&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave thrown a poor devil&rsquo;s rags in his face. Good-afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, Ben,&rdquo; said the old woman, in a changed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis, half-way through the door, started as though he had been shot,
      and, facing about, stood eyeing her in dumb bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I take you back again,&rdquo; repeated his wife, &ldquo;are you going to behave
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the same voice and it isn&rsquo;t the same face,&rdquo; said the old woman;
      &ldquo;but if I&rsquo;d only got a broomhandle handy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis made an odd noise in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been so down on your luck,&rdquo; said his wife, blinking her
      eyes rapidly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have let you go. If you hadn&rsquo;t looked &lsquo;so miserable I
      could have stood it. If I take you back, are you going to behave
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis stood gaping at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I take you back again,&rdquo; repeated his wife, speaking very slowly, &ldquo;are
      you going to behave yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, finding his voice at last. &ldquo;Yes, if you are.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want you to do,&rdquo; said Mr. George Wright, as he leaned towards the
      old sailor, &ldquo;is to be an uncle to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said the mystified Mr. Kemp, pausing with a mug of beer midway
      to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rich uncle,&rdquo; continued the young man, lowering his voice to prevent any
      keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge. &ldquo;An uncle from
      New Zealand, who is going to leave me all &lsquo;is money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s it coming from?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Kemp, with a little excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only got to say you&rsquo;ve got it.
      Fact of the matter is, I&rsquo;ve got my eye on a young lady; there&rsquo;s another
      chap after &lsquo;er too, and if she thought I&rsquo;d got a rich uncle it might make
      all the difference. She knows I &lsquo;ad an uncle that went to New Zealand and
      was never heard of since. That&rsquo;s what made me think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp drank his beer in thoughtful silence. &ldquo;How can I be a rich uncle
      without any brass?&rdquo; he inquired at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should &lsquo;ave to lend you some&mdash;a little,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man pondered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had money lent me before,&rdquo; he said, candidly,
      &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t call to mind ever paying it back. I always meant to, but
      that&rsquo;s as far as it got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be for a little while, and
      then you&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave a letter calling you back to New Zealand. See? And you&rsquo;ll
      go back, promising to come home in a year&rsquo;s time, after you&rsquo;ve wound up
      your business, and leave us all your money. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s sure to find it out in
      time,&rdquo; he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright. &ldquo;And p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps not. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time
      for me to get married before she does, and you could write back and say
      you had got married yourself, or given your money to a hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ordered some more beer for Mr. Kemp, and in a low voice gave him as
      much of the family history as he considered necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only known you for about ten days,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d sooner
      trust you than people I&rsquo;ve known for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took a fancy to you the moment I set eyes on you,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Kemp.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once,
      and was drowned afore my eyes the week after. He &lsquo;ad a bit of a squint,
      and I s&rsquo;pose that&rsquo;s how he came to fall overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He emptied his mug, and then, accompanied by Mr. Wright, fetched his
      sea-chest from the boarding-house where he was staying, and took it to the
      young man&rsquo;s lodgings. Fortunately for the latter&rsquo;s pocket the chest
      contained a good best suit and boots, and the only expenses incurred were
      for a large, soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain. Dressed in his
      best, with a bulging pocket-book in his breast-pocket, he set out with Mr.
      Wright on the following evening to make his first call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright, who was also in his best clothes, led the way to a small
      tobacconist&rsquo;s in a side street off the Mile End Road, and, raising his hat
      with some ceremony, shook hands with a good-looking young woman who stood
      behind the counter: Mr. Kemp, adopting an air of scornful dignity intended
      to indicate the possession of great wealth, waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my uncle,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, speaking rapidly, &ldquo;from New Zealand,
      the one I spoke to you about. He turned up last night, and you might have
      knocked me down with a feather. The last person in the world I expected to
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp, in a good rolling voice, said, &ldquo;Good evening, miss; I hope you
      are well,&rdquo; and, subsiding into a chair, asked for a cigar. His surprise
      when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost
      assumed the dimensions of a grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do to go on with,&rdquo; he said, smelling it suspiciously. &ldquo;Have you got
      change for a fifty-pound note?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Miss Bradshaw, concealing her surprise by an effort, said that she would
      see, and was scanning the contents of a drawer, when Mr. Kemp in some
      haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoat-pocket. Five
      minutes later he was sitting in the little room behind the shop, holding
      forth to an admiring audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I know,&rdquo; he said, in reply to a question of Mrs. Bradshaw&rsquo;s,
      &ldquo;George is the only relation I&rsquo;ve got. Him and me are quite alone, and I
      can tell you I was glad to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bradshaw sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you are so far apart,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for long,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going back for about a year
      to wind up things out there, and then I&rsquo;m coming back to leave my old
      bones over here. George has very kindly offered to let me live with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t suffer for it, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw, archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as money goes he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Not that that would
      make any difference to George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the same to me if you hadn&rsquo;t got a farthing,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Wright, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp, somewhat affected, shook hands with him, and leaning back in the
      most comfortable chair in the room, described his life and struggles in
      New Zealand. Hard work, teetotalism, and the simple life combined appeared
      to be responsible for a fortune which he affected to be too old to enjoy.
      Misunderstandings of a painful nature were avoided by a timely admission
      that under medical advice he was now taking a fair amount of stimulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he said, as he walked home with the elated George, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your
      game, not mine, and it&rsquo;s sure to come a bit expensive. I can&rsquo;t be a rich
      uncle without spending a bit. &lsquo;Ow much did you say you&rsquo;d got in the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be as careful as we can,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, hastily. &ldquo;One thing is
      they can&rsquo;t leave the shop to go out much. It&rsquo;s a very good little
      business, and it ought to be all right for me and Bella one of these days,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp, prompted by a nudge in the ribs, assented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how
      they took it all in about me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I feel certain in my own mind
      that I ought to chuck some money about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &lsquo;em of the money you have chucked about,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do
      just as well, and come a good deal cheaper. And you had better go round
      alone to-morrow evening. It&rsquo;ll look better. Just go in for another one of
      their sixpenny cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp obeyed, and the following evening, after sitting a little while
      chatting in the shop, was invited into the parlour, where, mindful of Mr.
      Wright&rsquo;s instructions, he held his listeners enthralled by tales of past
      expenditure. A tip of fifty pounds to his bedroom steward coming over was
      characterized by Mrs. Bradshaw as extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be going all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his
      report; &ldquo;but be careful; don&rsquo;t go overdoing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp nodded. &ldquo;I can turn &lsquo;em round my little finger,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      have Bella all to yourself to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright flushed. &ldquo;How did you manage that?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      first time she has ever been out with me alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t coming out,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to stay at home and
      mind the shop; it&rsquo;s the mother what&rsquo;s coming out. Going to spend the
      evening with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright frowned. &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; he demanded, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp, equably; &ldquo;they done it. The old lady says
      that, just for once in her life, she wants to see how it feels to spend
      money like water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Money like water!</i>&rdquo; repeated the horrified Mr. Wright. &ldquo;Money like&mdash;
      I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;money&rsquo; her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;I can have a headache or a chill,
      or something of that sort, if you like. I don&rsquo;t want to go. It&rsquo;s no
      pleasure to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will it cost?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Wright, pacing up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich uncle made a calculation. &ldquo;She wants to go to a place called the
      Empire,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;and have something for supper, and there&rsquo;d be
      cabs and things. I dessay it would cost a couple o&rsquo; pounds, and it might
      be more. But I&rsquo;d just as soon ave&rsquo; a chill&mdash;just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright groaned, and after talking of Mrs. Bradshaw as though she were
      already his mother-in-law, produced the money. His instructions as to
      economy lasted almost up to the moment when he stood with Bella outside
      the shop on the following evening and watched the couple go off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how well they get on together,&rdquo; said Bella, as they
      re-entered the shop and passed into the parlour. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen mother
      take to anybody so quick as she has to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you like him, too,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; said Bella. &ldquo;Fancy having all that money. I wonder what it
      feels like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall know some day,&rdquo; said the young man, slowly; &ldquo;but it
      won&rsquo;t be much good to me unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless?&rdquo; said Bella, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it gives me what I want,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner be a poor
      man and married to the girl I love, than a millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bradshaw stole an uneasy glance at his somewhat sallow features, and
      became thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good having diamonds and motor-cars and that sort of thing unless
      you have somebody to share them with,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bradshaw&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and at that moment the shop-bell tinkled
      and a lively whistle sounded. She rose and went into the shop, and Mr.
      Wright settled back in his chair and scowled darkly as he saw the
      intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;I want a sixpenny smoke for twopence,
      please. How are we this evening? Sitting up and taking nourishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bradshaw told him to behave himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always do,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I can never get anybody to
      play with. I had such an awful dream about you last night that I couldn&rsquo;t
      rest till I saw you. Awful it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; inquired Miss Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreamt you were married,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills, smiling at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bradshaw tossed her head. &ldquo;Who to, pray?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills, simply. &ldquo;I woke up in a cold perspiration. Halloa!
      is that Georgie in there? How are you, George? Better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, with dignity, as the other hooked the
      door open with his stick and nodded at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you look it?&rdquo; demanded the lively Mr. Hills. &ldquo;Have you
      got your feet wet, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be quiet,&rdquo; said Miss Bradshaw, smiling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-o,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills, dropping into a chair by the counter and
      caressing his moustache. &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me like that if you
      knew what a terrible day I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working,&rdquo; said the other, with a huge sigh. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the millionaire? I
      came round on purpose to have a look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him and mother have gone to the Empire?&rdquo; said Miss Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hills gave three long, penetrating whistles, and then, placing his
      cigar with great care on the counter, hid his face in a huge handkerchief.
      Miss Bradshaw, glanced from him to the frowning Mr. Wright, and then,
      entering the parlour, closed the door with a bang. Mr. Hills took the
      hint, and with a somewhat thoughtful grin departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in next evening for another cigar, and heard all that there was to
      hear about the Empire. Mrs. Bradshaw would have treated him but coldly,
      but the innocent Mr. Kemp, charmed by his manner, paid him great
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just like what I was at his age,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a patch on you,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills, edging his way by slow degrees
      into the parlour. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take young ladies to the Empire. Were you
      telling me you came over here to get married, or did I dream it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ark at him,&rdquo; said the blushing Mr. Kemp, as Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head
      at the offender and told him to behave himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man any woman might be happy with,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills. &ldquo;He never
      knows how much there is in his trousers-pocket. Fancy sewing on buttons
      for a man like that. Gold-mining ain&rsquo;t in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head at him again, and Mr. Hills, after
      apologizing to her for revealing her innermost thoughts before the most
      guileless of men, began to question Mr. Kemp as to the prospects of a
      bright and energetic young man, with a distaste for work, in New Zealand.
      The audience listened with keen attention to the replies, the only
      disturbing factor being a cough of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s, which became more and
      more troublesome as the evening wore on. By the time uncle and nephew rose
      to depart the latter was so hoarse that he could scarcely speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell &lsquo;em you had got a letter calling you home, as I told
      you?&rdquo; he vociferated, as soon as they were clear of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I forgot it,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgot it!&rdquo; repeated the incensed Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think I was coughing like that for&mdash;fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot it,&rdquo; said the old man, doggedly. &ldquo;Besides, if you take my
      advice, you&rsquo;d better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright laughed disagreeably. &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am managing
      this affair, not you. Now, you go round to-morrow afternoon and tell them
      you&rsquo;re off. D&rsquo;ye hear? D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m made of money? And what do you mean
      by making such a fuss of that fool, Charlie Hills? You know he is after
      Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked the rest of the way home in indignant silence, and, after giving
      minute instructions to Mr. Kemp next morning at breakfast, went off to
      work in a more cheerful frame of mind. Mr. Kemp was out when he returned,
      and after making his toilet he followed him to Mrs. Bradshaw&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his annoyance, he found Mr. Hills there again; and, moreover, it soon
      became clear to him that Mr. Kemp had said nothing about his approaching
      departure. Coughs and scowls passed unheeded, and at last in a hesitating
      voice, he broached the subject himself. There was a general chorus of
      lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t got the heart to tell you,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when
      I&rsquo;ve been so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t got to go back immediate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, before the old man could reply. &ldquo;Business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp smiled feebly. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to,&rdquo; he replied, in a
      hesitating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back,&rdquo;
       urged Mr. Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for a few days,&rdquo; pleaded Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To please us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw. &ldquo;Think &lsquo;ow George&rsquo;ll miss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay hold of him and don&rsquo;t let him go,&rdquo; said Mr. Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Mr. Kemp round the waist, and the laughing Bella and her mother
      each secured an arm. An appeal to Mr. Wright to secure his legs passed
      unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t let you go till you promise,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; said Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp; &ldquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must go back,&rdquo; shouted the alarmed Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him speak for himself,&rdquo; exclaimed Bella, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just another week then,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good having money if I
      can&rsquo;t please myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Wright, almost beside himself with rage and dismay.
      &ldquo;A week! Another week! Why, you told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t listen to him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw. &ldquo;Croaker! It&rsquo;s his own
      business, ain&rsquo;t it? And he knows best, don&rsquo;t he? What&rsquo;s it got to do with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s hand; Mr. Kemp patted back, and with his disengaged
      hand helped himself to a glass of beer&mdash;the fourth&mdash;and beamed
      in a friendly fashion upon the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; he said, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, in a harsh voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think to bring my pocket-book along with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, sharply; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tt-tt,&rdquo; said the old man, with a gesture of annoyance. &ldquo;Well, lend me a
      couple of pounds, then, or else run back and fetch my pocket-book,&rdquo; he
      added, with a sly grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright&rsquo;s face worked with impotent fury. &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;do you&mdash;want
      it for?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bradshaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Well! Well!&rdquo; seemed to sum up the general feeling; Mr.
      Kemp, shaking his head, eyed him with gentle reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and Mrs. Bradshaw are going to gave another evening out,&rdquo; he said,
      quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got a few more days, and I must make hay while the sun
      shines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. Wright the room seemed to revolve slowly on its axis, but,
      regaining his self-possession by a supreme effort, he took out his purse
      and produced the amount. Mrs. Bradshaw, after a few feminine
      protestations, went upstairs to put her bonnet on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can go and fetch a hansom-cab, George, while she&rsquo;s a-doing of
      it,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;Pick out a good &lsquo;orse&mdash;spotted-grey, if you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright arose and, departing with a suddenness that was almost
      startling, exploded harmlessly in front of the barber&rsquo;s, next door but
      one. Then with lagging steps he went in search of the shabbiest cab and
      oldest horse he could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankee, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as he helped Mrs. Bradshaw in
      and stood with his foot on the step. &ldquo;By the way, you had better go back
      and lock my pocket-book up. I left it on the washstand, and there&rsquo;s best
      part of a thousand pounds in it. You can take fifty for yourself to buy
      smokes with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of admiration, and Mr. Wright, with a frantic attempt
      to keep up appearances, tried to thank him, but in vain. Long after the
      cab had rolled away he stood on the pavement trying to think out a
      position which was rapidly becoming unendurable. Still keeping up
      appearances, he had to pretend to go home to look after the pocket-book,
      leaving the jubilant Mr. Hills to improve the shining hour with Miss
      Bradshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp, returning home at midnight&mdash;in a cab&mdash;found the young
      man waiting up for him, and, taking a seat on the edge of the table,
      listened unmoved to a word-picture of himself which seemed interminable.
      He was only moved to speech when Mr. Wright described him as a
      white-whiskered jezebel who was a disgrace to his sex, and then merely in
      the interests of natural science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; he said, as the other paused from exhaustion. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
      be for long now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long?&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, panting. &ldquo;First thing to-morrow morning you have
      a telegram calling you back&mdash;a telegram that must be minded. D&rsquo;ye
      see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp, plainly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back, never no more&mdash;never!
      I&rsquo;m going to stop here and court Mrs. Bradshaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright fought for breath. &ldquo;You&mdash;you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a try,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of going to sea,
      and it&rsquo;ll be a nice comfortable home for my old age. You marry Bella, and
      I&rsquo;ll marry her mother. Happy family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright, trembling with rage, sat down to recover, and, regaining his
      composure after a time, pointed out almost calmly the various difficulties
      in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it all out,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp, nodding. &ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m
      not rich till after we&rsquo;re married; then I &lsquo;ave a letter from New Zealand
      saying I&rsquo;ve lost all my money. It&rsquo;s just as easy to have that letter as
      the one you spoke of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m to find you money to play the rich uncle with till you&rsquo;re
      married, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, in a grating voice, &ldquo;and then lose
      Bella when Mrs. Bradshaw finds you&rsquo;ve lost your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp scratched his ear. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your lookout,&rdquo; he said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright, with great determination. &ldquo;Either you
      go and tell them that you&rsquo;ve been telegraphed for&mdash;cabled is the
      proper word&mdash;or I tell them the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll settle you then,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than the other would,&rdquo; retorted the young man, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll come
      cheaper. One thing I&rsquo;ll take my oath of, and that is I won&rsquo;t give you
      another farthing; but if you do as I tell you I&rsquo;ll give you a quid for
      luck. Now, think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kemp thought it over, and after a vain attempt to raise the promised
      reward to five pounds, finally compounded for two, and went off to bed
      after a few stormy words on selfishness and ingratitude. He declined to
      speak to his host at breakfast next morning, and accompanied him in the
      evening with the air of a martyr going to the stake. He listened in stony
      silence to the young man&rsquo;s instructions, and only spoke when the latter
      refused to pay the two pounds in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news, communicated in halting accents by Mr. Kemp, was received with
      flattering dismay. Mrs. Bradshaw refused to believe her ears, and it was
      only after the information had been repeated and confirmed by Mr. Wright
      that she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent over eleven pounds cabling to-day;
      but it&rsquo;s all no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re coming back?&rdquo; said Mr. Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo; course I am,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;George is the only relation I&rsquo;ve got,
      and I&rsquo;ve got to look after him, I suppose. After all, blood is thicker
      than water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bradshaw, piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s you and Bella,&rdquo; continued Mr. Kemp; &ldquo;two of the best that
      ever breathed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Charlie Hills; I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know <i>when</i> I&rsquo;ve took
      such a fancy to anybody as I have to &lsquo;im. If I was a young gal&mdash;a
      single young gal&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;the other half,&rdquo; he said, slowly, as he
      paused&mdash;&ldquo;just the one I should fancy. He&rsquo;s a good-&rsquo;arted,
      good-looking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw it mild,&rdquo; interrupted the blushing Mr. Hills as Mr. Wright bestowed
      a ferocious glance upon the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever, lively young fellow,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Kemp. &ldquo;George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now. I&rsquo;ve got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don&rsquo;t
      want you to come with me. I prefer to be alone. You stay here and cheer
      them up. Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o&rsquo; pounds out o&rsquo; 
      that fifty I gave you last night. I&rsquo;ve given all my small change away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and met Mr. Wright&rsquo;s eye; the latter, too affected to speak,
      took out the money and passed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never know what may happen to us,&rdquo; said the old man, solemnly, as he
      rose and buttoned his coat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I like to have things
      ship-shape. I&rsquo;ve spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer, and if
      anything &lsquo;appens to my old carcass it won&rsquo;t make any difference. I have
      left half my money to George; half of all I have is to be his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of an awed silence he went round and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other half,&rdquo; with his hand on the door&mdash;&ldquo;the other half and my
      best gold watch and chain I have left to my dear young pal, Charlie Hills.
      Good-bye, Georgie!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      The night-watchman appeared to be out of sorts. His movements were even
      slower than usual, and, when he sat, the soap-box seemed to be unable to
      give satisfaction. His face bore an expression of deep melancholy, but a
      smouldering gleam in his eye betokened feelings deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play-acting I don&rsquo;t hold with,&rdquo; he burst out, with sudden ferocity.
      &ldquo;Never did. I don&rsquo;t say I ain&rsquo;t been to a theayter once or twice in my
      life, but I always come away with the idea that anybody could act if they
      liked to try. It&rsquo;s a kid&rsquo;s game, a silly kid&rsquo;s game, dressing up and
      pretending to be somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cut off a piece of tobacco and, stowing it in his left cheek, sat
      chewing, with his lack-lustre eyes fixed on the wharves across the river.
      The offensive antics of a lighterman in mid-stream, who nearly fell
      overboard in his efforts to attract his attention, he ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might ha&rsquo; known it, too,&rdquo; he said, after a long silence. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only
      stopped to think, instead o&rsquo; being in such a hurry to do good to others, I
      should ha&rsquo; been all right, and the pack o&rsquo; monkey-faced swabs on the <i>Lizzie
      and Annie</i> wot calls themselves sailor-men would &lsquo;ave had to &lsquo;ave got
      something else to laugh about. They&rsquo;ve told it in every pub for &lsquo;arf a
      mile round, and last night, when I went into the Town of Margate to get a
      drink, three chaps climbed over the partition to &lsquo;ave a look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all began with young Ted Sawyer, the mate o&rsquo; the <i>Lizzie and Annie</i>.
      He calls himself a mate, but if it wasn&rsquo;t for &lsquo;aving the skipper for a
      brother-in-law &lsquo;e&rsquo;d be called something else, very quick. Two or three
      times we&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad words over one thing and another, and the last time I
      called &lsquo;im something that I can see now was a mistake. It was one o&rsquo; these
      &lsquo;ere clever things that a man don&rsquo;t forget, let alone a lop-sided monkey
      like &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was when they was up time afore last, and when they made fast &lsquo;ere
      last week I could see as he &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t forgotten it. For one thing he
      pretended not to see me, and, arter I &lsquo;ad told him wot I&rsquo;d do to him if &lsquo;e
      ran into me agin, he said &lsquo;e thought I was a sack o&rsquo; potatoes taking a
      airing on a pair of legs wot somebody &lsquo;ad throwed away. Nasty tongue &lsquo;e&rsquo;s
      got; not clever, but nasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arter that I took no notice of &lsquo;im, and, o&rsquo; course, that annoyed &lsquo;im more
      than anything. All I could do I done, and &lsquo;e was ringing the gate-bell
      that night from five minutes to twelve till ha&rsquo;-past afore I heard it.
      Many a night-watchman gets a name for going to sleep when &lsquo;e&rsquo;s only
      getting a bit of &lsquo;is own back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stood there talking for over &lsquo;arf-an-hour arter I &lsquo;ad let&rsquo;im in.
      Leastways, he did. And whenever I see as he was getting tired I just said,
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;sh!&rsquo; and &lsquo;e&rsquo;d start agin as fresh as ever. He tumbled to it at last,
      and went aboard shaking &lsquo;is little fist at me and telling me wot he&rsquo;d do
      to me if it wasn&rsquo;t for the lor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept by the gate as soon as I came on dooty next evening, just to give
      &lsquo;im a little smile as &lsquo;e went out. There is nothing more aggravating than
      a smile when it is properly done; but there was no signs o&rsquo; my lord, and,
      arter practising it on a carman by mistake, I &lsquo;ad to go inside for a bit
      and wait till he &lsquo;ad gorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coast was clear by the time I went back, and I &lsquo;ad just stepped
      outside with my back up agin the gate-post to &lsquo;ave a pipe, when I see a
      boy coming along with a bag. Good-looking lad of about fifteen &lsquo;e was,
      nicely dressed in a serge suit, and he no sooner gets up to me than &lsquo;e
      puts down the bag and looks up at me with a timid sort o&rsquo; little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening, cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; he ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t the fust that has made that mistake; older people than &lsquo;im have
      done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening, my lad,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; he ses, in a trembling voice, &lsquo;I suppose you ain&rsquo;t looking
      out for a cabin-boy, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cabin-boy?&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve run away from &lsquo;ome to go to sea,&rsquo; he ses, and I&rsquo;m afraid of being
      pursued. Can I come inside?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afore I could say &lsquo;No&rsquo; he &lsquo;ad come, bag and all; and afore I could say
      anything else he &lsquo;ad nipped into the office and stood there with his &lsquo;and
      on his chest panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know I can trust you,&rsquo; he ses; &lsquo;I can see it by your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot &lsquo;ave you run away from &lsquo;ome for?&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Have they been
      ill-treating of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ill-treating me?&rsquo; he ses, with a laugh. &lsquo;Not much. Why, I expect my
      father is running about all over the place offering rewards for me. He
      wouldn&rsquo;t lose me for a thousand pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pricked up my ears at that; I don&rsquo;t deny it. Anybody would. Besides, I
      knew it would be doing him a kindness to hand &lsquo;im back to &lsquo;is father. And
      then I did a bit o&rsquo; thinking to see &lsquo;ow it was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; I ses, putting three or four ledgers on the floor behind one
      of the desks. &lsquo;Sit down, and let&rsquo;s talk it over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked away for ever so long, but, do all I would, I couldn&rsquo;t persuade
      &lsquo;im. His &lsquo;ead was stuffed full of coral islands and smugglers and pirates
      and foreign ports. He said &lsquo;e wanted to see the world, and flying-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I love the blue billers,&rsquo; he ses; &lsquo;the heaving blue billers is wot I
      want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to explain to &lsquo;im who would be doing the heaving, but &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t
      listen to me. He sat on them ledgers like a little wooden image, looking
      up at me and shaking his &lsquo;ead, and when I told &lsquo;im of storms and
      shipwrecks he just smacked &lsquo;is lips and his blue eyes shone with joy.
      Arter a time I saw it was no good trying to persuade &lsquo;im, and I pretended
      to give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think I can get you a ship with a friend o&rsquo; mine,&rsquo; I ses; &lsquo;but, mind,
      I&rsquo;ve got to relieve your pore father&rsquo;s mind&mdash;I must let &lsquo;im know
      wot&rsquo;s become of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not before I&rsquo;ve sailed,&rsquo; he ses, very quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Certingly not,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;But you must give me &lsquo;is name and address, and,
      arter the Blue Shark&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name of your ship&mdash;is clear of
      the land, I&rsquo;ll send &lsquo;im a letter with no name to it, saying where you ave
      gorn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem to like it at fust, and said &lsquo;e would write &lsquo;imself, but
      arter I &lsquo;ad pointed out that &lsquo;e might forget and that I was responsible,
      &lsquo;e gave way and told me that &lsquo;is father was named Mr. Watson, and he kept
      a big draper&rsquo;s shop in the Commercial Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked a bit arter that, just to stop &lsquo;is suspicions, and then I told
      &lsquo;im to stay where &lsquo;e was on the floor, out of sight of the window, while I
      went to see my friend the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood outside for a moment trying to make up my mind wot to do.
      O&rsquo;course, I &lsquo;ad no business, strictly speaking, to leave the wharf, but,
      on the other &lsquo;and, there was a father&rsquo;s &lsquo;art to relieve. I edged along bit
      by bit while I was thinking, and then, arter looking back once or twice to
      make sure that the boy wasn&rsquo;t watching me, I set off for the Commercial
      Road as hard as I could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so young as I was. It was a warm evening, and I &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t got even a
      bus fare on me. I &lsquo;ad to walk all the way, and, by the time I got there, I
      was &lsquo;arf melted. It was a tidy-sized shop, with three or four nice-looking
      gals behind the counter, and things like babies&rsquo; high chairs for the
      customers to sit onlong in the leg and ridikerlously small in the seat. I
      went up to one of the gals and told Per I wanted to see Mr. Watson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On private business,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Very important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at me for a moment, and then she went away and fetched a tall,
      bald-headed man with grey side-whiskers and a large nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wot d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo; he ses, coming up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want a word with you in private,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is private enough for me,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Say wot you &lsquo;ave to say, and be
      quick about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drawed myself up a bit and looked at him. &lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you ain&rsquo;t missed &lsquo;im
      yet,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Missed &lsquo;im?&rsquo; he ses, with a growl. &lsquo;Missed who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your-son. Your blue-eyed son,&rsquo; I ses, looking &lsquo;im straight in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; he ses, spluttering. &lsquo;You be off. &lsquo;Ow dare you come here
      with your games? Wot d&rsquo;ye mean by it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; I ses, getting a bit out o&rsquo; temper, &lsquo;that your boy has run away
      to go to sea, and I&rsquo;ve come to take you to &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed so upset that I thought &lsquo;e was going to &lsquo;ave a fit at fust, and
      it seemed only natural, too. Then I see that the best-looking girl and
      another was having a fit, although trying &lsquo;ard not to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t get out o&rsquo; my shop,&rsquo; he ses at last, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave you locked
      up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good!&rsquo; I ses, in a quiet way. &lsquo;Very good; but, mark my words, if
      he&rsquo;s drownded you&rsquo;ll never forgive yourself as long as you live for
      letting your temper get the better of you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never know a good
      night&rsquo;s rest agin. Besides, wot about &lsquo;is mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One o&rsquo; them silly gals went off agin just like a damp firework, and Mr.
      Watson, arter nearly choking &lsquo;imself with temper, shoved me out o&rsquo; the way
      and marched out o&rsquo; the shop. I didn&rsquo;t know wot to make of &lsquo;im at fust, and
      then one o&rsquo; the gals told me that &lsquo;e was a bachelor and &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t got no son,
      and that somebody &lsquo;ad been taking advantage of what she called my
      innercence to pull my leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You toddle off &lsquo;ome,&rsquo; she ses, &lsquo;before Mr. Watson comes back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to let &lsquo;im come out alone,&rsquo; ses one o&rsquo; the other gals.
      &lsquo;Where do you live, gran&rsquo;pa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see then that I &lsquo;ad been done, and I was just walking out o&rsquo; the shop,
      pretending to be deaf, when Mr. Watson come back with a silly young
      policeman wot asked me wot I meant by it. He told me to get off &lsquo;ome
      quick, and actually put his &lsquo;and on my shoulder, but it &lsquo;ud take more than
      a thing like that to push me, and, arter trying his &lsquo;ardest, he could only
      rock me a bit.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went at last because I wanted to see that boy agin, and the young
      policeman follered me quite a long way, shaking his silly &lsquo;ead at me and
      telling me to be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a ride part o&rsquo; the way from Commercial Road to Aldgate by getting
      on the wrong bus, but it wasn&rsquo;t much good, and I was quite tired by the
      time I got back to the wharf. I waited outside for a minute or two to get
      my wind back agin, and then I went in-boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might ha&rsquo; knocked me down with a feather, as the saying is, and I
      just stood inside the office speechless. The boy &lsquo;ad disappeared and
      sitting on the floor where I &lsquo;ad left &lsquo;im was a very nice-looking gal of
      about eighteen, with short &lsquo;air, and a white blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening, sir,&rsquo; she ses, jumping up and giving me a pretty little
      frightened look. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry that my brother has been deceiving you.
      He&rsquo;s a bad, wicked, ungrateful boy. The idea of telling you that Mr.
      Watson was &lsquo;is father! Have you been there? I do &lsquo;ope you&rsquo;re not tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gorn,&rsquo; she ses, shaking her &lsquo;ead. &lsquo;I begged and prayed of &lsquo;im to
      stop, but &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t. He said &lsquo;e thought you might be offended with &lsquo;im.
      &ldquo;Give my love to old Roley-Poley, and tell him I don&rsquo;t trust &lsquo;im,&rdquo; he
      ses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She stood there looking so scared that I didn&rsquo;t know wot to say. By and
      by she took out &lsquo;er little pocket-&rsquo;ankercher and began to cry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, get &lsquo;im back,&rsquo; she ses. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let it be said I follered &lsquo;im &lsquo;ere
      all the way for nothing. Have another try. For my sake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow can I get &lsquo;im back when I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s gorn?&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He-he&rsquo;s gorn to &lsquo;is godfather,&rsquo; she ses, dabbing her eyes. &lsquo;I promised
      &lsquo;im not to tell anybody; but I don&rsquo;t know wot to do for the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps his godfather will &lsquo;old on to &lsquo;im,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He won&rsquo;t tell &lsquo;im anything about going to sea,&rsquo; she ses, shaking &lsquo;er
      little head. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s just gorn to try and bo&mdash;bo-borrow some money to
      go away with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She bust out sobbing, and it was all I could do to get the godfather&rsquo;s
      address out of &lsquo;er. When I think of the trouble I took to get it I come
      over quite faint. At last she told me, between &lsquo;er sobs, that &lsquo;is name was
      Mr. Kiddem, and that he lived at 27, Bridge Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the kindest-&rsquo;arted and most generous men that ever lived,&rsquo; 
      she ses; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why my brother Harry &lsquo;as gone to &lsquo;im. And you needn&rsquo;t
      mind taking anything &lsquo;e likes to give you; he&rsquo;s rolling in money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it a bit easier going to Bridge Street, but the evening seemed
      &lsquo;otter than ever, and by the time I got to the &lsquo;ouse I was pretty near
      done up. A nice, tidy-looking woman opened the door, but she was a&rsquo; most
      stone deaf, and I &lsquo;ad to shout the name pretty near a dozen times afore
      she &lsquo;eard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He don&rsquo;t live &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; she ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;As he moved?&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Or wot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shook her &lsquo;cad, and, arter telling me to wait, went in and fetched
      her &lsquo;usband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never &lsquo;eard of him,&rsquo; he ses, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;ere seventeen years. Are
      you sure it was twenty-seven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sartain,&rsquo; I ses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, he don&rsquo;t live &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Why not try thirty-seven and
      forty-seven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried&rsquo;em: thirty-seven was empty, and a pasty-faced chap at forty-seven
      nearly made &lsquo;imself ill over the name of &lsquo;Kiddem.&rsquo; It &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t struck me
      before, but it&rsquo;s a hard matter to deceive me, and all in a flash it come
      over me that I &lsquo;ad been done agin, and that the gal was as bad as &lsquo;er
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so done up I could &lsquo;ardly crawl back, and my &lsquo;ead was all in a
      maze. Three or four times I stopped and tried to think, but couldn&rsquo;t, but
      at last I got back and dragged myself into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I &lsquo;arf expected, it was empty. There was no sign of either the gal or
      the boy; and I dropped into a chair and tried to think wot it all meant.
      Then, &lsquo;appening to look out of the winder, I see somebody running up and
      down the jetty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see plain owing to the things in the way, but as soon as I got
      outside and saw who it was I nearly dropped. It was the boy, and he was
      running up and down wringing his &lsquo;ands and crying like a wild thing, and,
      instead o&rsquo; running away as soon as &lsquo;e saw me, he rushed right up to me and
      threw &lsquo;is grubby little paws round my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Save her!&rsquo; &lsquo;e ses. &lsquo;Save &lsquo;er! Help! Help!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; I ses, shoving &lsquo;im off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She fell overboard,&rsquo; he ses, dancing about. &lsquo;Oh, my pore sister! Quick!
      Quick! I can&rsquo;t swim!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ran to the side and pointed at the water, which was just about at
      &lsquo;arf-tide. Then &lsquo;e caught &lsquo;old of me agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Make &lsquo;aste,&rsquo; he ses, giving me a shove behind. &lsquo;Jump in. Wot are you
      waiting for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood there for a moment &lsquo;arf dazed, looking down at the water. Then I
      pulled down a life-belt from the wall &lsquo;ere and threw it in, and, arter
      another moment&rsquo;s thought, ran back to the <i>Lizzie and Annie,</i> wot was
      in the inside berth, and gave them a hail. I&rsquo;ve always &lsquo;ad a good voice,
      and in a flash the skipper and Ted Sawyer came tumbling up out of the
      cabin and the &lsquo;ands out of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gal overboard!&rsquo; I ses, shouting.

      &ldquo;The skipper just asked where, and then &lsquo;im and the mate and a couple of
      &lsquo;ands tumbled into their boat and pulled under the jetty for all they was
      worth. Me and the boy ran back and stood with the others, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Point out the exact spot,&rsquo; ses the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy pointed, and the skipper stood up in the boat and felt round with
      a boat-hook. Twice &lsquo;e said he thought &lsquo;e touched something, but it turned
      out as &lsquo;e was mistaken. His face got longer and longer and &lsquo;e shook his
      &lsquo;ead, and said he was afraid it was no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stand cryin&rsquo; &lsquo;ere,&rsquo; he ses to the boy, kindly. &lsquo;Jem, run round for
      the Thames police, and get them and the drags. Take the boy with you.
      It&rsquo;ll occupy &lsquo;is mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;ad another go with the boat-hook arter they &lsquo;ad gone; then &lsquo;e gave it
      up, and sat in the boat waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This&rsquo;ll be a bad job for you, watchman,&rsquo; he ses, shaking his &lsquo;ead.
      &lsquo;Where was you when it &lsquo;appened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been missing all the evening,&rsquo; ses the cook, wot was standing
      beside me. &lsquo;If he&rsquo;d been doing &lsquo;is dooty, the pore gal wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave been
      drownded. Wot was she doing on the wharf?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Skylarkin&rsquo;, I s&rsquo;pose,&rsquo; ses the mate. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder there ain&rsquo;t more
      drownded. Wot can you expect when the watchman is sitting in a pub all the
      evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook said I ought to be &lsquo;ung, and a young ordinary seaman wot was
      standing beside &lsquo;im said he would sooner I was boiled. I believe they &lsquo;ad
      words about it, but I was feeling too upset to take much notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Looking miserable won&rsquo;t bring &lsquo;er back to life agin,&rsquo; ses the skipper,
      looking up at me and shaking his &lsquo;ead. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go down to my cabin
      and get yourself a drop o&rsquo; whisky; there&rsquo;s a bottle on the table. You&rsquo;ll
      want all your wits about you when the police come. And wotever you do
      don&rsquo;t say nothing to criminate yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do the criminating for &lsquo;im all right,&rsquo; ses the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I was the pore gal I&rsquo;d haunt &lsquo;im,&rsquo; ses the ordinary seaman; &lsquo;every
      night of &lsquo;is life I&rsquo;d stand afore &lsquo;im dripping with water and moaning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she will,&rsquo; ses the cook; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s &lsquo;ope so, at any rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t answer &lsquo;em; I was too dead-beat. Besides which, I&rsquo;ve got a
      &lsquo;orror of ghosts, and the idea of being on the wharf alone of a night
      arter such a thing was a&rsquo;most too much for me. I went on board the <i>Lizzie
      and Annie,</i> and down in the cabin I found a bottle o&rsquo; whisky, as the
      skipper &lsquo;ad said. I sat down on the locker and &lsquo;ad a glass, and then I sat
      worrying and wondering wot was to be the end of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whisky warmed me up a bit, and I &lsquo;ad just taken up the bottle to &lsquo;elp
      myself agin when I &lsquo;eard a faint sort o&rsquo; sound in the skipper&rsquo;s
      state-room. I put the bottle down and listened, but everything seemed
      deathly still. I took it up agin, and &lsquo;ad just poured out a drop o&rsquo; whisky
      when I distinctly &lsquo;eard a hissing noise and then a little moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a moment I sat turned to stone. Then I put the bottle down quiet, and
      &lsquo;ad just got up to go when the door of the state-room opened, and I saw
      the drownded gal, with &lsquo;er little face and hair all wet and dripping,
      standing before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted Sawyer &lsquo;as been telling everybody that I came up the companion-way
      like a fog-horn that &lsquo;ad lost its ma; I wonder how he&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave come up if
      he&rsquo;d &lsquo;ad the evening I had &lsquo;ad?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were all on the jetty as I got there and tumbled into the skipper&rsquo;s
      arms, and all asking at once wot was the matter. When I got my breath back
      a bit and told &lsquo;em, they laughed. All except the cook, and &lsquo;e said it was
      only wot I might expect. Then, like a man in a dream, I see the gal come
      out of the companion and walk slowly to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;Look. There she is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming,&rsquo; ses the skipper, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all said the same, even when the gal stepped on to the side and
      climbed on to the wharf. She came along towards me with &lsquo;er arms held
      close to &lsquo;er sides, and making the most &lsquo;orrible faces at me, and it took
      five of&rsquo;em all their time to &lsquo;old me. The wharf and everything seemed to
      me to spin round and round. Then she came straight up to me and patted me
      on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pore old gentleman,&rsquo; she ses. &lsquo;Wot a shame it is, Ted! It&rsquo;s too bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They let go o&rsquo; me then, and stamped up and down the jetty laughing fit to
      kill themselves. If they &lsquo;ad only known wot a exhibition they was making
      of themselves, and &lsquo;ow I pitied them, they wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it. And by
      and by Ted wiped his eyes and put his arm round the gal&rsquo;s waist and ses&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is my intended, Miss Florrie Price,&rsquo; he ses. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a little
      wonder? Wot d&rsquo;ye think of &lsquo;er?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my own opinion,&rsquo; I ses. &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to say against
      gals, but if I only lay my hands on that young brother of &lsquo;ers&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went off agin then, worse than ever; and at last the cook came and
      put &lsquo;is skinny arm round my neck and started spluttering in my ear. I
      shoved &lsquo;im off hard, because I see it all then; and I should ha&rsquo; seen it
      afore only I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave time to think. I don&rsquo;t bear no malice, and all I
      can say is that I don&rsquo;t wish &lsquo;er any harder punishment than to be married
      to Ted Sawyer.&rdquo;

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook&rsquo;s
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
